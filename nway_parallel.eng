This year's World Environment Day campaign slogan is-''Only One Earth''.
And those who live such a lifestyle are called ''Pro-Planet People''.
The secret behind the Earth's long life is the harmony our ancestors maintained with nature.
When it comes to tradition, almost all parts of the world have traditions that show a simple and sustainable solution to environmental problems.
We in India have equated nature with divinity.
Our gods and goddesses have plants and animals associated with them.
Our forest cover is increasing and so is the population of lions, tigers, leopards, elephants and rhinos.
We have achieved 10% ethanol blending in petrol, 5 months ahead of the November 2022 target.
This has enhanced India's energy security, reduced crude oil import of more than 5.5 billion dollars.
It has also reduced Carbon Dioxide emissions by 2.7 million tonnes.
And it has increased income of farmers by almost 5.5 billion dollars.
Renewable energy is becoming widely popular and our government has very high focus for development of this sector.
India stands ready to support any effort for a better environment and to further global wellness.
Together let us make our planet better.
“These lines will bring ease of life for the residents of the ever-mobile metropolitan city of Mumbai”
Maharashtra Governor Shri Bhagat Singh Koshyari ji, Chief Minister Shri Uddhav Thackeray ji, my colleagues in the Union Cabinet Ashwini Vaishnaw ji and Raosaheb Danve ji, Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra Ajit Pawar ji, former Chief Minister of Maharashtra Devendra Fadnavis ji, MPs and MLAs, brothers and sisters!
First- Now there will be separate lines for local and express trains.
Second- Trains going to and from Mumbai for other states will no longer have to wait for the passage of local trains.
Thirty-six new local trains will run on the Central Railway line from today.
The Mumbai suburban rail system is being equipped with modern and best technology.
Therefore, Ahmedabad-Mumbai High-Speed ​​Rail is the need of Mumbai and the country today.
During the Corona period itself, we have connected the farmers with markets across the country through Kisan Rails.
Today, more than 6000 railway stations have been connected with Wi-Fi facilities.
Vande Bharat Express trains are giving speed and modern facilities to India’s railways.
In coming years, 400 new Vande Bharat trains will start serving the countrymen.
The endeavors to develop these new facilities will greatly benefit Mumbai and its surrounding cities.
With commitment to the relentless development of Mumbai, I once again heartily congratulate all Mumbaikars.
“Uniqueness and surprise elements can only happen when the equipment is developed in your own country”
“This year's budget has a blueprint for developing a vibrant ecosystem from research, design and development to manufacturing within the country”
Apart from this, the procurement process related to equipment worth more than Rs 4.5 lakh crore is also in various stages.
“Transparent, time-bound, pragmatic and fair systems of trial, testing and certification are essential to the growth of a vibrant defence industry”
The theme of today's webinar ‘Atma-Nirbharta in Defence - Call to Action’ explains the intentions of the nation.
Our defence manufacturing was very powerful even during the period of servitude and immediately after independence.
Weapons made in India played a big role in the Second World War.
Although this strength of ours kept on weakening in the later years, it shows that there was never a shortage of capacity in India then and there is no shortage even now.
This year's budget has a blueprint for developing a vibrant ecosystem from research, design and development to manufacturing (defence equipment) within the country.
About 70 percent of the defence budget has been earmarked for the domestic industry only.
So far, the Defence Ministry has released the Positive Indigenization List of more than 200 defence platforms and equipment.
Very soon, the third list will be out.
Its solution also lies in the AatmaNirbhar Bharat campaign and Make in India.
Prior to last year, we created seven new Defence Public Undertakings.
It is also very pleasant that we have increased defence exports by six times in the last five-six years.
Today we are providing Made-in-India defence equipment and services to more than 75 countries.
As a result of the government's encouragement to the Make in India, more than 350 new industrial licenses have been issued for defence manufacturing in the last seven years.
Twenty-five percent of the Defence R&D budget has been set aside for industry, start-ups and academia so that the private sector should also come on par with DRDO and defence PSUs.
My best wishes to you!
Our Farmers Producer Organizations-FPO have a major role in organizing the growing potential of small farmers of the country.
When 130 crore Indians take one step forward together, it is not just one step, it is 130 crore steps.
Thousands of wellness centers have also been built in 2021.
Today, the growth rate of our economy is more than 8 percent.
Record foreign investment has come to India.
Our foreign exchange reserves have reached record levels.
We have also set new paradigms in terms of exports and especially agriculture.
Today more than 50,000 start-ups are operating in India.
Of these, more than 10,000 start-ups were formed in the last six months.
In 2021, India also opened the doors of the National Defence Academy for women.
The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan will provide a new impetus to the pace of infrastructure construction in the country.
Giving new dimensions to Make in India, the country has launched ambitious plans for new sectors like chip manufacturing and semiconductors.
There is a great way to save our earth from becoming barren and that is chemical-free farming.
I heartily congratulate President Joko Widodo for giving effective leadership to the G-20 in a challenging global environment.
Global supply chains are in ruins.
There is a crisis of essentials, essential goods all over the world.
The challenge for the poor citizens of every country is more severe.
And we have all failed to make suitable reforms in them.
Therefore, today the world has greater expectations from the G-20, the relevance of our group has become more significant.
Over the past century, the Second World War wreaked havoc in the world.
After that, the leaders of that time made a serious effort to take the path of peace.
The need of the hour is to show concrete and collective resolve to ensure peace, harmony and security in the world.
I am confident that next year when the G20 meets in the holy land of Buddha and Gandhi, we will all agree to convey a strong message of peace to the world.
During the pandemic, India ensured food security of its 1.3 billion citizens.
At the same time, food grains were also supplied to many countries in need.
The current shortage of fertilizers in terms of food security is also a huge crisis.
We should build mutual agreement to maintain the supply chain of both manure and food grains stable and assured.
Millets can also solve global malnutrition and hunger.
We all must celebrate the International Year of Millets with great enthusiasm next year.
India's energy-security is also important for global growth, as it is the world's fastest growing economy.
Time-bound and affordable finance and sustainable supply of technology to developing countries is essential for inclusive energy transition.
During India's G-20 Presidency, we will work for global consensus on all these issues.
“Manipur Sangai Festival highlights the spirit and passion of the people of Manipur”
“Manipur is exactly like an elegant garland where one can witness a mini India”
“The Sangai Festival celebrates the biodiversity of India”
“When we make nature, animals and plants part of our festivals and celebrations, then co-existence becomes a natural part of our life”
Heartiest congratulations to all the people of Manipur for successfully organizing the Sangai Festival!
During this 'Amritkaal', the country is moving forward with the spirit of 'Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat'.
Sangai is not only the state animal of Manipur, but also has a special place in India's social values and traditions.
It also celebrates India's cultural and spiritual ties with nature.
I am told that this time the Sangai Festival was organized not only in the capital city but also in the entire state, elevating the spirit of "Festival of One-ness".
From the Nagaland border to the Myanmar border, diverse colours of the festival were seen at around 14 locations.
With this spirit, thank you very much everyone!
Sree Narayana Dharma Sangham Trust President Swami Satchidananda ji, General Secretary Swami Ritambharananda ji, my colleagues in the Union Council of Ministers and the sons of the soil of Kerala, Sri V. Muraleedharan ji and Rajeev Chandrasekhar ji, officials of the Sree Narayana Guru Dharma Sangham Trust, all the devotees from the country and abroad, ladies and gentlemen,
With the grace of the saints and the blessings of Shri Narayana Guru, I have been privileged to be amongst you all earlier also.
In keeping the philosophy of India alive, the people of Kerala have always been instrumental in this spiritual and scientific development journey of India and have also taken the lead when needed.
He spoke of education and science, but at the same time never shied away from glorifying our thousands of years of the old tradition of religion and faith.
One Caste, One Religion, One God's call of Shri Narayana Guru ji gives a spiritual height to our sense of patriotism.
And we all know that no goal in the world is impossible when Indians are united.
Our achievements in the journey of these hundred years should be global, and for that our vision should also be global.
“Technology for us is a medium to empower the people of the country.
For us, technology is the basis for making the country self-reliant.
“We have to emphasize on how to make maximum use of technology for the Ease of Living.
“The world has seen our reliability from our self-sustainability to vaccine production at the time of Covid.
We have to replicate this success in every sector”
You all know that we have started a new tradition for the past two years.
You must have seen the decisions taken related to science and technology in this budget.
All these decisions are really important.
Science and technology is not just an isolated sector for our government.
Today, our vision in the field of economy is related to the basic foundations like digital economy and Fintech.
Technology for us is a powerful medium to empower the common citizens of the country.
And when I talk about India's self-reliance, even today you must have heard the speech of the US President Biden this morning.
Artificial Intelligence, Geospatial Systems, Drones, Semi-conductors and Space Technology, Genomics, Pharmaceuticals, Clean Technologies and 5G, all these sectors are the priority of the country today.
A portal has also been proposed for skilling, re-skilling and up-skilling of youth in the budget.
With this, youth will get the right jobs and opportunities through API based trusted skill credentials, payment and discovery layers.
It is heartening to see our tricolor being unfurled with pride, honor and glory, not only in all the corners of India, but also worldwide by Indians who love their country immensely.
I extend my heartiest congratulations to all the people spread across the globe who love India.
This is a day of historic importance.
This is an auspicious occasion to step forward on a new path, with a new resolution and a new strength.
In the pursuit of Independence, the entire period of slavery was spent in struggle.
Today is an opportunity for all of us countrymen to bow down and salute all such brave hearts, the legends of every sacrifice made by every great soul.
All the countrymen are deeply indebted to Pujya Bapu, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, Babasaheb Ambedkar, Veer Savarkar, who devoted all their life on the path of duty towards the nation.
This nation is grateful to those brave women, be it Rani Lakshmibai, Jhalkari Bai, Durga Bhabhi, Rani Gaidinliu, Rani Chennamma, Begum Hazrat Mahal, Velu Nachiyar, who showed the mettle of women power of India.
When we talk about the freedom struggle, we cannot forget to acknowledge our tribal society living in forests.
The people held programs in every district, every corner, of India to enlarge the scope of goals of the ‘Amrit Mahotsav’ of Independence.
Today, the nation sought out all such heroes and great men, selfless, brave men from every corner of the country and paid tributes to them.
Their determination to start a new life with their love for India is inspirational and worth saluting.
This journey of 75 years has been full of ups and downs.
The world was not cognizant that India has an inherent potential of strong culture and values, a bond of thoughts deeply embedded in mind and soul.
And we are proud that today every corner of India, every section and strata of our society is brimming with aspirations.
Until 10th August, people would not even be aware of the power within the country.
The world is looking at India with pride and with anticipation.
This change in the world, this change in the thinking of the world is the result of our experience and journey of the last 75 years.
The world is observing the way we have started moving ahead with the resolution, and ultimately the world too is living with a new hope.
130 crore countrymen after several decades of experience have shown the world the importance of a stable government, the power of political stability, policies and how trust develops in the policies.
And now when there is political stability, dynamism in policies, speed in decision making, ubiquity and universal trust, then everyone becomes a partner in development.
So, we have seen our collective power and collective potential.
And we must take up the responsibility of fulfilling all the dreams of the freedom fighters by embracing those 'Panch Pran' by 2047 when the country celebrates 100 years of independence.
This is our second Pran Shakti.
And hence we should be proud of this heritage.
It is the strength of our resolve that will be crucial in achieving the dreams in the next 25 years.
Providing electricity connection to 2.5 crore people in such a short time was not a small task, but the country has done it.
Today the country is rapidly providing 'water from tap' to the homes of lakhs of families.
Experience tells us that we can achieve our goals once we are determined.
Shall we not set our own standards?
We want freedom from slavery.
We should be proud of every language of our country.
Today we are witnessing the structure of Digital India.
These are our youngsters who are coming before the world today with new discoveries.
But when it talks about holistic health care, it looks towards India's yoga, India's Ayurveda and India's holistic lifestyle.
This is our legacy that we are providing the world with.
The world is being influenced by it today.
We have that legacy and the solutions to the problems of global warming.
When we talk about an environment-friendly lifestyle and LIFE mission, we attract the attention of the world.
We have this power.
Due to the sacrifices made by our mothers and sisters over the centuries, the 'joint family system' has evolved as a legacy.
We are those people who see Shiva in every living being.
We are people who call women 'Narayani'.
We are the people who consider the rivers as mother.
It is our heritage to care for the happiness and good health of all.
Gender equality is our first stipulation.
There should be success in the life of the individual, of the society, of the family, of the nation.
It is the job of the government to make efforts to provide 24 hours electricity but it is the duty of the citizen to save as many units as he can.
It is the responsibility and efforts of the government to supply water to every field, but a voice should come from each of my fields that we will move forward by saving water by focusing on 'per drop more crop'.
Friends, whether it is police or people, ruler or administrator, no one can be untouched by this civic duty.
If everyone performs the duties of a citizen, I am sure that we can achieve the desired goals ahead of time.
And, therefore, ‘AatmaNirbhar Bharat’ becomes the responsibility of every citizen, every government and every unit of society.
‘AatmaNirbhar Bharat’ is not a government agenda or a government programme.
My dear brothers and sisters, today I want to congratulate the soldiers of the army of my country from my heart.
In this resolution, I can see the seed of a bright future of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' that will convert this dream into a banyan tree.
They are generating new employment opportunities.
India is becoming a manufacturing hub.
Be it manufacturing of electronic goods or mobile phones, today the country is progressing at a very fast pace.
Today the Vande Bharat train and our metro coaches are becoming objects of attraction for the world.
Today natural farming is also a way of becoming self-reliant.
But natural farming and chemical-free farming can give a boost to self-reliance.
Today, new employment opportunities in the form of green jobs are opening up very fast in the country.
India has opened up 'space' through its policies.
We have opened up new doors of opportunities for the youth of the country.
One of the dreams of a self-reliant India is to ensure that India does not lag behind in fulfilling the needs of the world.
I am fully informed that the dream of Digital India will be attained through rural India.
Today I am happy that four lakh Common Service Centers of India are being developed in villages,
Nation can take pride in the fact that four lakh Digital Entrepreneurs are being nurtured in the villages, and the rural population is becoming accustomed to benefit from all the services.
We have 75 years of experience, and we have also achieved many accomplishments in these 75 years.
But, what should be the optimum outcome of our human resources for the ‘Amrit Kaal?
I want to say something from the experience of the last few years.
Our ‘Nari Shakti’ is devotedly engaged in solving the problems of our villages.
In every walk of life, whether it is the playground or the battlefield, the ‘Nari Shakti’ of India is coming forward with a new strength and a new belief.
They will take the country to a new height.
Programs may differ, working styles may differ, but resolutions can’t differ, dreams for a nation cannot be different.
Let us move towards such an era.
There are many states of our country, which have played a great role in taking the country forward, have led and worked as examples in many fields.
This gives strength to our federalism.
Every state should feel that it is moving ahead, that it will race ahead by toiling hard.
There should be an atmosphere of competition between the states and all the units of the government which should strive to take us to new peaks of development.
And I believe that because of all these challenges and problems if we do not take corrective steps while there is still time during 25 years of 'Amrit Kaal', then it could take a turn for the worse.
So, I do not want to discuss everything but would definitely want to focus on two issues.
One is corruption and the other is nepotism and the dynasty system.
So we have to fight against corruption with all our might.
In the last eight years, we have been successful in working for the betterment of the country by saving two lakh crore rupees which used to go into the wrong hands, using all the modern systems like Direct Benefit Transfer, Aadhaar and Mobile.
Those who fled the country after looting banks during the tenure of the previous government, we have seized their property and are trying to get them back.
I can clearly see that we are entering a crucial period against corruption.
With this spirit, India is now stepping into a decisive period against corruption.
I have to fight against it, intensify the fight and have to take it to a decisive point.
Unless there is hatred towards filth in the society, the consciousness for cleanliness does not arise.
And that's why we need to be very aware of corruption and corrupt people.
Similarly, in politics too, family bias or dynasty has done the most injustice to the country's strength.
Such a mentality is not good for any country.
Dear youth of my country, for your bright future, for your dreams, I seek your support in the fight against nepotism.
I want your support in the fight against dynastic politics.
I consider this as my constitutional responsibility.
And hence I request you to support this opportunity.
When 130 crore countrymen take one step ahead with a set goal and the commitment to resolve, India moves 130 steps forward.
To live for the motherland each day, every moment of time and every particle of life will be our true tribute to the freedom fighters.
I urge the countrymen to start the ‘Amrit Kaal’ today by nurturing new possibilities, realizing new resolutions and moving ahead with confidence.
Present on the dais Pujya Swami ji, Karnataka Governor Shri Thawar Chand Gehlot ji, popular Chief Minister Shri Basavaraj Bommai ji, former Chief Minister Shri Yediyurappa ji, my colleagues in the Union Cabinet, Ministers in the State Government, MPs, legislators, all other dignitaries and my dear brothers and sisters who have come in large numbers.
I am privileged that I have got the opportunity to come to Bengaluru on a very special day.
While honoring these great personalities, we are empowering both the development and heritage of Bengaluru and Karnataka.
Today Karnataka got the first Made in India Vande Bharat train.
This train connects Chennai, the country's start-up capital Bengaluru and the heritage city of Mysuru.
Today the second terminal of Kempegowda International Airport has also been inaugurated.
This gigantic statue of Nadaprabhu Kempegowda will inspire us to work relentlessly and dedicatedly for the future of Bengaluru and India.
Today, Karnataka is also benefiting from the unprecedented trust that has been created for investment in India from across the world.
Imagine, about 4 lakh crore rupees were invested in Karnataka in the last three years when the entire world was battling Covid.
Karnataka has led the country in attracting FDI in the last year.
And the investment is not limited to the IT sector alone.
Karnataka has 25 percent share in the aircraft and spacecraft industry in the country.
About 70 percent of the aircraft and helicopters for the country's army are made here.
We have to enrich it with modern infrastructure, while preserving our heritage.
Once again, I congratulate all of you very much for the new projects.
“We have decided that half the seats in private medical colleges will be charged at par with government medical colleges”
It was very satisfying as I got an opportunity to talk to many people in different corners of the country today.
If we look at the figures of this financial year, then more than 800 crore rupees worth of medicines have been sold through Jan Aushadhi Kendras.
It means that the poor and the middle-class people have saved 5,000 crore rupees in this financial year only through the Jan Aushadhi Kendras.
Sanitary napkins for women are also available for one rupee at these centers.
The sale of over 21 crore sanitary napkins is proof that Jan Aushadhi Kendras are making life easier for a large number of women.
There are more than 50 crore people under the ambit of the Ayushman Bharat scheme.
More than three crore people have taken advantage of it since the launch of this scheme.
They have got free treatment in hospitals.
In the absence of this scheme, our poor brothers and sisters would have to spend about 70,000 crore rupees.
But we tried from day one that the poor and not a single citizen of India had to spend any money for vaccination.
Best wishes to all of you once again.
“Democracy is not just a system for India.
Democracy is ingrained in our nature and part of life in India”
“Fight against Corona pandemic is a great example of ‘Sabka Prayas’”
This important conference of presiding officers is held every year with some new discussions and new resolutions.
It is also very pleasant that today this tradition is completing 100 years.
This is also the good fortune of all of us, and it is also a symbol of India's democratic expansion.
We have to take the country to newer heights, achieve extraordinary goals in the years to come.
These resolutions will be fulfilled only through ‘Sabka Prayas (everyone's effort).
When we talk about 'Sabka Prayas' in democracy, the federal system of India, then the role of all the states is a big basis for that.
There are many things which the country has done in the last few years with everyone’s efforts whether it is the resolution of the decades-old problems of the Northeast or completion of all the big projects of development that have been stuck for decades.
Our country is full of diversity.
Can we think of setting aside time for quality debate?
Your journey of 75 years is a testimony to how fast time changes.
Next 25 years are very important for India.
I once again congratulate you all very much and many thanks.
“Amrit Kaal gives us the opportunity to work towards a strong, developed and inclusive India”
“Every media house took up Swachh Bharat Mission with great sincerity”
“Media has played a very encouraging role in popularising Yoga, fitness and BetiBachaoBetiPadhao”
“Powered by India’s talented youth, our nation is moving towards Aatmanirbharta or self-reliance”
“The guiding principle of our efforts is to ensure the future generations lead a better lifestyle than the present ones”
We fully understand the importance of next generation infrastructure.
Rupees 110 Lakh crore are being spent on a National Infrastructure Pipeline.
We are actively working to ensure every village of India has high-speed internet connectivity.
The guiding principle of our efforts is to ensure the future generations lead a better lifestyle than the present ones.
Years ago, when Mahatma Gandhi visited Mathrubhumi he had said and I quote: Mathrubhumi is an institution that has stood firmly on its own feet.
Only can a few newspapers in India do this.
I once again congratulate Mathrubhumi for their centenary celebrations and convey my best wishes to the readers.
Mr. President, it is always a great pleasure to meet you.
Today we also participated together in another positive and useful Quad Summit.
Our shared values, and our common interests in many areas, including security, have strengthened the bonds of this trust.
Our people-to-people relations and close economic ties also make our partnership unique.
Trade and investment between us is also expanding continuously, although it is still much below our potential.
We are increasing our bilateral cooperation in the field of technology, and also strengthening mutual coordination on global issues.
I am confident that the friendship between India and USA will continue to be a force for good for global peace and stability, for the sustainability of the planet, and for the well-being of mankind.
Gandhian values are becoming very relevant.
Whether it is about ending conflicts, or about the climate crisis, Mahatma Gandhi's thoughts hold answers to many of today's burning issues.
The best tribute to Mahatma Gandhi is to act on his beloved thoughts.
In the last 8 years, the sales of the Khadi sector saw an increase of over 300%.
Mahatma Gandhi saw Khadi as a tool of self-reliance in the villages.
.He saw the seeds of self-reliant India in the self-reliance of the villages.
It is important to understand Mahatma Gandhi's approach to rural development.
He wanted villages to be developed.
Expansion of complete rural sanitation, tap water to over 6 crore households, 2.5 crore electricity connections, more roads in rural areas, taking development closer to people's homes.
The concept of cleanliness was beloved to Mahatma Gandhi.
Today the benefits of modern science and technology are also reaching the villages.
6 lakh kilometres of optic fibre cable have been laid to connect nearly 2 lakh gram panchayats.
Mahatma Gandhi fought for a united and independent India.
Gandhigram itself is a story of India’s unity.
Tamil Nadu has always been the home of national consciousness.
It will celebrate the bond between Kashi and Tamil Nadu.
The people of Kashi are eager to celebrate Tamil Nadu’s language, culture and history.
Today, I am in a region which has seen the power of Nari Shakti.
You will help rural women succeed.
Their success is the nation’s success.
At a time when the world faced the worst crisis in a century, India has been a bright spot.
Be it the world's largest vaccine drive, food security for the poorest of the poor, or being the growth engine of the world, India has shown its potential.
The world expects great things from India.
Because the future of India lies in the hands of the youth generation who can make everything possible.
New dairy complex and potato processing plant at Diyodar, Banaskantha district, built at a cost of over Rs. 600 crores.
Laid foundation stone of four gobar gas plants of 100 tonnes capacity to be established at Khimana, Ratanpura – Bhildi, Radhanpur and Thawar.
“In the last several years, the Banas Dairy has become a hub for empowering local communities, especially farmers and women”
“The manner in which Banaskantha has made a mark in agriculture is commendable.
Farmers embraced new technologies, focused on water conservation and the results are for all to see.
I bow before this holy land of Maa Nareshwari and Maa Ambaji.
Here one can experience clearly how the rural economy and the empowerment of mothers and sisters can be strengthened and how the cooperative movement can give a push to the AatmaNirbhar Bharat campaign.
This center has been equipped with modern facilities like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Big Data Analysis, etc.
My colleagues in the Union Cabinet Shri Rajnath Singh Ji, Shri Ajay Bhatt Ji, Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Chief of Naval Staff, Defence Secretary, President of SIDM, all colleagues associated with industry and academia, other dignitaries, ladies and gentlemen!
The goal of self-reliance in the Indian armed forces is very essential for the India of the 21st century.
I think this is a very important step to organize the first ‘Swavlamban’ seminar for a self-reliant navy, and for this I congratulate all of you very much and I wish you all the best.
Joint exercises in military preparedness, especially in the Navy, play a major role.
In this joint exercise for self-reliance, every stakeholder, including the Navy, Industry, MSMEs, academies, i. e. people from across the world and representatives of the government, are contemplating about the goal of coming together.
The goal of this joint exercise is maximum exposure for all the participants, greater understanding towards each other and adoption of the best practices.
Therefore, the goal of this joint exercise is very important.
Our seas and coastal borders are great custodians of our economic self-reliance and also provide impetus to it.
Therefore, the role of the Indian Navy is continuously increasing.
Hence, it is very important for the Navy to be self-supporting not only for itself but also for the growing needs of the country.
I am sure, this seminar and the nectar that came out of it, will help a lot in making our forces self-reliant.
At a time when we are discussing a self-reliant future in the defence sector, it is also necessary that we learn lessons from what happened in the past decades.
This will help us in paving the way for the future.
When we look back, we find we had a rich maritime heritage.
India's rich trade route has been a part of this legacy.
The knowledge of our ancestors regarding the direction of the wind during different seasons, and how to get to the destination by utilising the wind’s direction was a great strength.

UPI processed around 4.2 billion transactions in just last month.
When income grows, investment becomes possible.
Insurance coverage enables greater risk taking ability and investments.
GIFT City is not merely a premise, It represents the promise of India.
India has always been a maritime civilization.
Our ancient scriptures and literature talk about the gifts of the oceans including marine life.
Today, our security and prosperity are linked to oceans.
We hope for a legally binding international treaty this year.
“This Budget will create new opportunities for the common people along with providing strength to the economy”
This budget addresses the immediate needs and also ensures the bright future of the youth of the country.
Special attention has been paid so that every poor person should have a pucca house, tap water, toilet, gas connection, etc.
Simultaneously, there is an equal emphasis on modern internet connectivity.
This scheme will create a modern system of transportation and connectivity on the mountains.
Natural farming will be encouraged along the banks of the Ganges in the states of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal.
Be it a special fund to encourage new agriculture start-ups, or a new package for the food processing industry, this will go a long way in increasing the income of farmers.
More than Rs 2.25 lakh crore is being transferred directly to the accounts of farmers through the MSP purchase.
Along with a record increase in credit guarantee, many other schemes have been announced in this budget.
Public investment to the tune of Rs 7.50 lakh crore will give a new impetus to the economy and create new opportunities for small and other sectors of industries.
We have made the highest ever allocation to our annual healthcare budget.
Our vaccination programme is the largest in the world.
India manufactures four WHO approved vaccines and has the capacity to produce five billion doses this year.
We supplied over 200 million doses to 98 countries, bilaterally and through COVAX.
India has developed low-cost COVID mitigation technologies for testing, treating and data management.
In India, we extensively used our traditional medicines to supplement our fight against COVID and to boost immunity, saving countless lives.
Last month, we laid the foundation of ''WHO Centre for Traditional Medicine'' in India, with an aim to make this age-old knowledge available to the World.
It is clear that a coordinated global response is required to combat future health emergencies.
As a responsible member of the global community, India is ready to play a key role in these efforts.
Heartiest congratulations to all of you for the Khelo India University Games!
The city of Bengaluru itself is the identity of the youth of the country.
Organizing Khelo India in Digital India hub Bengaluru itself is of immense importance.
I congratulate the Government of Karnataka for organizing these games.
You will experience it in the Khelo India University Games.
This team spirit also gives you a new way of looking at life.
Many players among you will play at the state level in future.
This experience of your sports field will help you in every field of life.
The power and the knowledge that takes you forward in sports will also take you forward in life.
Friends, you are the youth of New India.
Your youthful thinking and your youthful approach are deciding the policies of the nation today.
Be it the emphasis on sports in the New Education Policy or the creation of modern sports infrastructure, transparency in the selection of players or the increasing use of modern technology in sports, this is the hallmark of New India.
The power of sports expands the power of the country.
I still remember when I met the players who had just returned from the Tokyo Olympics.
More than their personal victory, their faces reflected the pride of winning for the country.
With this belief, once again my heartiest wishes to all my young friends from across the country!
“To make India developed, it is equally important to develop its health services”
“Holistic healthcare has been placed among the top priorities in the country in the last eight years”
Punjab Governor Shri Banwari Lal Purohit ji, Chief Minister Shri Bhagwant Mann ji, my colleague in the Union Cabinet Dr.Jitendra Singh ji, my colleague in Parliament Manish Tewari ji, all doctors, researchers, paramedics, other employees and my dear sisters and brothers who have come from every nook and corner of Punjab!
The country is moving towards achieving new resolutions in the ‘Amrit Kaal’ of independence.
Today's program is also a reflection of the improving health services of the country.
Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital and Research Center is going to benefit the people of Punjab, Haryana as well as Himachal Pradesh.
Today I want to express my gratitude to this land for another reason.
A few days ago, all of us took a pledge from the Red Fort to make our country a developed India.
To make India developed, it is equally important to develop its health services.
When the people of India will get modern hospitals and facilities for treatment, then they will get well sooner, their energy will be channeled in the right direction and they will be more productive.
Today the country has also got a modern hospital in the form of Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital and Research Center.
The Central Government's Tata Memorial Center has played an important role in the establishment of this modern facility.
This center is saving the lives of cancer patients by providing its services in the country and abroad.
The Government of India is playing a leading role in the creation of modern cancer facilities in the country.
I am told that the Tata Memorial Center now has the facility to treat 1.5 lakh new patients every year.
This has been a great relief for cancer patients.
I remember people from far flung areas of Himachal used to come to PGI in Chandigarh for the treatment of many serious diseases, including cancer.
Due to the huge crowd in the PGI, the patient as well as his family members had to face many problems.
Now an AIIMS has been established in Bilaspur in Himachal Pradesh and such a huge facility has been created for the treatment of cancer.
A good healthcare system doesn't just mean building four walls.
Healthcare system of any country becomes strong only when it provides solutions in every way and supports it step by step.
Therefore, holistic healthcare has been placed among the top priorities in the country in the last eight years.
The amount of work which has been done in the health sector in India in the last 7-8 years has not been done in the last 70 years.
Today, the health facilities of the country are being improved and strengthened by working together on not one, or two, but six fronts for the health of the poorest of the poor.
The first front is the promotion of preventive healthcare.
The third front is to open medical colleges and big institutions of medical research in cities Fourth is increasing the number of doctors and paramedical staff in the country.
The fifth front is to provide affordable medicines and equipment to the patients.
And the sixth front is to ameliorate the problems faced by patients by using technology.
The Central Government is making record investment by spending thousands of crores today on these six fronts.
“Due to the splendid hard work of the sportspersons, the country is entering into the Azadi ka Amrit Kaal with an inspiring achievement”
“Athletes inspire the youth of the country to do better not only in sports but also in other sectors”
Over the last few weeks, the country has made two major achievements in the field of sports.
Along with the historic performance in the Commonwealth Games, the country organized Chess Olympiad for the first time.
I congratulate all the players who participated in the Chess Olympiad and all the medal winners on this occasion today.
I said, in a way made a promise to all of you ahead of the Commonwealth Games that we will celebrate the victory festival together upon your return.
Compared to last time, we have scored victories in four new games.
With this performance, the inclination of youth towards new sports in the country is going to increase a lot.
This shows how much the confidence of our youth is increasing today.
I once again wish you all the best on this victory journey!
The Governor of Madhya Pradesh, Shri Mangubhai Patel ji, the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Shivraj Singh Chouhan ji, the Union Railway Minister, Shri Ashwini Vaishnav ji, other dignitaries present here and brothers and sisters,
But when the country sincerely mobilizes for the fulfillment of its resolutions, then improvement comes and change happens.
Today's India is not only making record investments in modern infrastructure, it is also ensuring that projects are not delayed and there is no hindrance.
There was a time when railway infrastructure projects took several years to get off the ground after the planning.
But today if there is so much impatience in planning new projects in Indian Railways, there is even more seriousness to complete them on time.
This potential of Indian Railways is being explored on such a large scale for the first time after so many decades of independence.
Earlier, even if the railway was used for tourism, it was confined to a premium club.
Once again, I congratulate all of you for the modern railway station as well as for many new railway services.
And for this, we are also committed to extend all possible support to Japanese companies in India.
"History created today on the occasion of skill convocation of more than 9 lakh students of Industrial Training Institute"
“Vishwakarma Jayanti is the honour of every person who works hard in the true sense, it is the day of labour”
“In India, we have always seen a portrayal of God in the skills of the labourer, They are seen in the form of Vishwakarma”
“To make this the century of India, it is very important that the youth of India should be equally proficient in education as well as skill”
“Special provision for the recruitment of youth in the army who have taken technical training from ITIs”
“The role of ITIs is very important in this, our youth should make the most out of these possibilities”
“India has quality in skills, and also diversity”
“When a youth has the power of education as well as the power of skill, then his self-confidence automatically increases”
I am privileged that I have got an opportunity today to interact with the students of lakhs of ITIs of the country.
Students from various institutions related to skill development, teachers, other dignitaries of the world of education, ladies and gentlemen!
Today a new history has been created in our country marching ahead in the 21st century.
More than 40 lakh students are also connected with us through virtual medium.
I can confidently say that as pleasant as your beginning is, your journey to the future will also be more creative.
Wishing you and all the countrymen a very Happy Lord Vishwakarma Jayanti!
Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) also have a big role to play in India's success in this era of Fourth Industrial Revolution, i. e. , 'Industry 4.0'.
Today many major countries of the world need skilled workforce to fulfill their dreams and to maintain their pace.
Many opportunities are waiting for you in the country as well as abroad.
What you have learned today will definitely become the basis of your future, but you will also have to upgrade your skills according to the future.
Therefore, when it comes to skills, your mantra should be 'Skilling, 'Re-skilling' and 'Up-skilling'.
I am sure you will move ahead at this pace, and will give direction to the better future of New India with your skills.
It is a matter of pride for me that today I have got an opportunity to interact with young people like you who have talent, skills and big dreams on the occasion of Vishwakarma Jayanti.
“In coming two years Gober Dhan Bio CNG plants will be established in 75 big Municipal bodies”
“It is government’s effort to make most of Indian cities water plus.
This is being stressed in the second phase of Swachh Bharat Mission”
When we were young and studying, the first thing that used to come to mind at the mention of Indore was Devi Ahilyabai Holkar, Maheshwar and her spirit of service.
Today is going to provide new strength to Indore's campaign for cleanliness.
I would like to appreciate Shivraj ji and his team, in particular, for making it possible in such a short span of time.
Today I will also express my gratitude to Sumitra Tai, who took Indore's identity to new heights as an MP.
My colleague and the current MP of Indore Shankar Lalwani ji is also following in her footsteps and working continuously to make Indore better.
Today, when I am praising Indore so much, I will also mention my parliamentary constituency Varanasi.
I am happy that a very beautiful statue of Devi Ahilyabai Holkar ji has been installed in Kashi Vishwanath Dham.
Today's effort is very important to keep our cities pollution-free and to dispose of wet waste.
It is estimated that the CNG produced in this plant will be able to run about 400 buses every day in Indore city.
Today, millions of tons of garbage in cities across the country have occupied thousands of acres of land for decades.
It is also a major cause for the diseases caused by air and water pollution in the cities.
Therefore, the emphasis in the second phase of the Swachh Bharat Mission is on dealing with this problem.
The goal is to free our cities from these mountains of garbage and convert them into green zones in the next two-three years.
For this, all possible help is being given to the state governments.
There is no city in our country that does not have historical places or holy places.
When the cities are clean, people from other places also feel like visiting there and more people will come.
The supply of ethanol for blending has also been greatly increased in the last seven years.
Today, I pay my respectful salutations to each of my sanitation brothers and sisters of Indore from Delhi.
Had you not continued this cleanliness campaign during the Corona period, we would have faced so many new troubles.
The children of three to four years old tell their grandfather not to scatter garbage.
’ The efforts of the Bal Sena will strengthen the foundation of our future India.
Prime Minister Kishida, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and President Biden.
Prime Minister Kishida, thank you very much for your wonderful hospitality.
It's a great pleasure for me to be among friends in Tokyo today.
I first of all congratulate Prime Minister Anthony Albanese for the victory in elections, many congratulations.
Your being with us only after 24 hours of taking the oath shows the strength of Quad friendship and your commitment to it.
In such a short time, Quad has assumed an important place on the world stage.
Today the scope of Quad has become broader and the format has become effective.
Our mutual trust, our determination, is giving new energy and enthusiasm to the democratic forces.
In spite of the adverse circumstances of COVID-19, we have increased coordination in many areas such as vaccine-delivery, climate action, supply chain resilience, disaster response and economic cooperation.
This will further strengthen the image of the Quad as a 'Force for Good'.
First of all, many congratulations and best wishes to Prime Minister Lapid on assuming the office as the Prime Minister.
I would also like to thank him for hosting today's summit.
By mobilizing the mutual strengths of our countries - Capital, Expertise and Markets - we can accelerate our agenda, and contribute significantly to the global economy.
That is, when there is amalgamation of knowledge and science, when we get introduced to knowledge and science, then it leads to solutions to all the problems of the world automatically.
In the West, many such scientists like Einstein, Fermi, Max Planck, Niels Bohr and Tesla were surprising the world with their experiments.
In the same period, countless Indian scientists like C. V. Raman, Jagadish Chandra Bose, Satyendra Nath Bose, Meghnad Saha, S. Chandrasekhar were bringing forth their discoveries.
Due to the efforts of the government, India is ranked 46th in the Global Innovation Index today, whereas India was at 81 position in 2015.
Science, technology and innovation are in the DNA of today's young generation.
Special emphasis has also been laid in the new National Education Policy so that the education of science and technology can be made available to the student in his mother tongue.
These 25 years will stand India out in the world with a new identity, strength and potential.
“Use of science for nature and amalgamation of technology with spirituality is the soul of dynamic India”
“Today the world is looking at our startups as its future.
My young colleagues joining the Rozgar Mela,
Today, appointment letters are being given to more than 71,000 youths in 45 cities of the country.
Today a new era of prosperity has begun in thousands of homes.
Last month, on this day on Dhanteras, appointment letters were distributed to 75,000 youths by the Central Government.
Thousands of youths have been given jobs through the ‘Rozgar Melas’ in Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu and Chandigarh in the last one month.
There are many online courses available on the 'Karmayogi Bharat' technology platform which has been launched recently.
Today there is a crisis of new opportunities in front of the youth all over the world due to the global pandemic and the ongoing war.
Today India has become a major power of the world in terms of service exports.
Be it ‘Make in India’, ‘Vocal for Local’, or ‘Local to Global’, all these campaigns are creating new opportunities for employment and self-employment in the country.
All-round new opportunities are being created for the youth in India today from start-ups to self-employment and from space to drones.
Today, more than 80,000 start-ups of India are giving opportunities to the youth to show their potential in various fields.
Whether it is the supply of medicines or spraying of pesticides, mapping by drones of lands in the Svamitva scheme or the defence sector, the use of drones is continuously increasing in the country.
And this increasing use of drones is giving new jobs to the youth.
We have already seen how the private sector of India successfully launched its first space rocket 2-3 days ago.
“Tripura is becoming a land of opportunities through relentless efforts of the double engine government”
I respectfully congratulate all the great personalities who contributed to the building and development of Tripura and salute their efforts!
Today this state is becoming a hub of trade corridors through large connectivity infrastructure.
Today Tripura is getting rail, air, inland waterway along with the roads.
The double engine government met this demand when the first transit cargo from Bangladesh arrived at the Akhaura Integrated Check Post in 2020.
A few days ago, the Maharaja Bir Bikram Airport has also been expanded.
Whatever has happened in three years is just the beginning.
From transparency in administration to modern infrastructure, the Tripura that is being built today will prepare the state for decades to come.
This effort of the government will go a long way in making life easier for the people of Tripura.
When India completes 100 years of its independence, then Tripura will also be completing 75 years of its statehood.
This is a very good time for new resolutions and opportunities.
“People of Himachal Pradesh have converted challenges into opportunities”
“The ‘double engine government’ has taken the initiative of expanding rural roads, highway widening, railway network and results are now visible”
“Honest leadership, peace loving environment, blessings of gods & goddesses and people of Himachal who work hard, all these are incomparable.
Himachal has everything needed for rapid development”
Hearty greetings to all the people of Devbhoomi on Himachal Day!
What a wonderful coincidence that during the 75th year of the country's independence, Himachal Pradesh is also celebrating its 75th Foundation Day!
But the diligent, honest and hardworking people of Himachal had converted this challenge into opportunities.
Many parameters like horticulture, surplus power, literacy rate, rural road network, door-to-door water and electricity facilities show the progress of this hill state.
For the last 7-8 years, the Central Government has been making relentless efforts to ensure that the condition of Himachal, the facilities there are made better.
In the coming 25 years, we will see the completion of 100 years of the formation of Himachal Pradesh as well as the country's independence.
This is the "Amritkaal' of new resolutions for us.
In this period, we have to take Himachal further in areas like tourism, higher education, research, IT, bio-technology, food-processing and natural farming.
These schemes will also increase remote connectivity, promote tourism and create new employment opportunities in Himachal Pradesh.
Himachal has done a commendable job especially in terms of social security.
Honest leadership, peace loving environment, blessings of gods and goddesses and the hardworking people of Himachal; everything is unparalleled.
Himachal Pradesh has everything needed for rapid development.
I hope Himachal continues to contribute in building a prosperous and strong India!
“All communities play their part as per their capacity and Patidar community is never left behind in fulfilling their role for the society”
"The Prime Minister said that in the form of the Statue of Equality, India has paid a fitting tribute to Sardar Patel"
“Malnutrition is often a result of lack of knowledge about food rather than the lack of food itself”
The popular Chief Minister of Gujarat Shri Bhupendrabhai Patel, my colleague in Parliament and president of Gujarat BJP Shri CR Patil, President of Annapurnadham Trust, my colleague in Parliament Narhari Amin, other office bearers, public representatives, senior members of society, sisters and brothers…
In this holy abode of Maa Annapurna, the constant opportunity that I get to connect with the great rituals related to faith, spirituality and social responsibilities, the temple's Bhoomi Poojan, the temple's pran pratishtha, the hostel's Bhoomi Poojan and today's inauguration Happening.
Today, along with the inauguration of Shri Annapurnadham Trust, Adalaj Kumar Hostel and Education Complex, foundation laying ceremony of the Hiramani Arogya Dham by the Jansahayak Trust has also taken place.
Gujarat's nature has been good for the society in the field of education, nutrition and health.
Whatever the strength, every society fulfills some or the other social responsibility and in that the Patidar community also never lags behind.
Many congratulations and best wishes to all of you on my behalf!
Friends, we have had great faith in Annapurna, the goddess of prosperity and wealth.
The Patidar community has been directly connected with Mother Earth.
This idol of Mata was stolen from Kashi decades ago and sent to foreign countries decades ago.
Dozens of such symbols of our culture have been brought back from abroad in the last seven-eight years.
Friends, In our culture, in our tradition, there has always been a lot of emphasis on food, health and education.
You all deserve appreciation for all these humanitarian efforts, dedication towards service.
Ignorance towards food increases the chances of malnutrition.
This is the need of Gujarat and accordingly we are taking Gujarat forward on the path of progress.
“The circumstances in which Somnath temple was destroyed, and the circumstances in which the temple was renovated by the efforts of Sardar Patel, both carry a big message”
“Today, development of tourist centres is not just a part of the government schemes, but a campaign of public participation.
The heritage sites of the country and the development of our cultural heritage is great example of this.
“It is necessary for our thinking to be innovative and modern.
The circumstances in which the Somnath temple was destroyed, and the circumstances in which the temple was renovated by the efforts of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, have a great message for us.
The places of faith and culture like Somnath are important centers of what we want to learn from the past of the country during the Amrit Mahotsav of freedom.
We have as much potential as it is in each country of the world in every state and region.
These places represent the spirit of our national unity, ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat’ (One India, Supreme India).
Another important factor in promoting tourism is convenience.
Time is the third important aspect of increasing tourism.
People want to cover maximum places in minimum time.
It is necessary for our thinking to be innovative and modern.
The makeover happened only for a few families in Delhi after independence.
Similarly, grandeur has been added to places associated with great personalities like Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Shyamji Krishna Varma.
“Hard work is our only path and victory is our only option”
Along with tackling Omicron, we have to start preparations for any more possible variants in future.
Chief Ministers thank the Prime Minister for his leadership during the successive waves of Covid-19
The more we limit the corona infection, the less the problem will be.
Vaccines made in India are proving their superiority all over the world.
Within 10 days, India has also vaccinated about three crore adolescents.
The sooner the precautionary dose is given to the frontline workers and senior citizens, the stronger our healthcare system will become.
“It is the growing influence of India that we have brought thousands of students back to our homeland from Ukraine”
The students who adopted the vision and values of Symbiosis and gave an identity to Symbiosis with their success have also contributed equally in this journey.
I extend many best wishes to the entire Symbiosis family for this new initiative as well.
I am glad that this tradition is still alive in our country.
Today the students of this institute represent the generation that has infinite opportunities before them.
Today our country is one of the largest economies of the world.
Today's India is innovating, improving and influencing the whole world.
The people of Pune know very well how India has exhibited its potential to the world in the matter of corona vaccines.
You are also witnessing how India is evacuating its citizens safe from the war zone during the Ukraine crisis by running Operation Ganga.
Many major countries of the world are facing problems in this regard.
But it is the growing influence of India that we have brought thousands of students back to our homeland.
Therefore, we are opening many sectors for you.
Today, I would like to urge something to the Symbiosis family and all those who are sitting here,
I also invite you to share your suggestions and experiences with the government as well.
You can also send your research, results, ideas and suggestions on these themes to the Prime Minister's Office.
I am sure of amazing results when professors, faculty and students become a part of this campaign.
You can imagine the huge amount of your contribution to the country in the next 25 years when you will celebrate 75 years of your university when 50,000 minds would have worked on 25 different themes.
I am very grateful to all of you for giving me the opportunity to interact with the new generation.
“The movement under the leadership of Gandhiji against the injustice of the British had made the British government realize the collective power of us Indians”
“A perception was developed that we have to be careful of the uniformed personnel.
“Stress-free training activities is need of the hour for strengthening the country's security apparatus”
Governor of Gujarat Acharya Devvrat ji, Home Minister Shri Amit Shah, Chief Minister Shri Bhupendra Patel, Vice-Chancellor of Rashtriya Raksha University Vimal Patel ji, officers, teachers, university students, parents, other excellencies, ladies and gentlemen!
With this belief, I extend my best wishes to all the youth.
“Goa government has come up with a new blueprint for the development of the state”
Today the Government of Goa has taken a vital step towards providing employment to the youth.
Several youngsters will be given appointment letters today in various departments of the Government of Goa.
This will further strengthen the Goa Police force and this will ensure better security of citizens, especially the tourists.
I am glad that the states where the BJP-ruled governments, that is, the double engine governments are there, the state governments are also organizing such 'Rozgar Melas'.
In the last 8 years, the Central Government has invested thousands of crores of rupees for the development of Goa.
Steps are also being taken to strengthen the rural economy of Goa and to increase employment opportunities in traditional farming.
The most crucial 25 years of your lives are going to begin now.
I am sure that all of you will continue to follow the path of your duty with full dedication and enthusiasm.
Once again my heartiest congratulations and best wishes to all of you!
I am also happy to see that the sapling of the Mahabodhi tree that I had presented at this place in 2014 is now developing into a tree.
The place where I was born, Vadnagar in Gujarat, was a great center of Buddhist learning centuries ago.
From Sarnath, Bodh Gaya and Kushinagar in India to Lumbini in Nepal, these holy places symbolize our shared heritage and shared values.
In this historic moment, my cabinet colleagues Shri Hardeep Puri ji, Shri G. Kishan Reddy ji, Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal ji, Smt Meenakshi Lekhi ji and Shri Kaushal Kishore ji are also present on the stage with me today.
The country has got a new inspiration and energy today in the Amrit Mahotsav of Independence.
Today we are filling new colors to the portrait of tomorrow leaving behind the past.
This new aura which is visible everywhere is the aura of confidence of New India.
Today a new history has been created in the form of Kartavya Path.
I congratulate all the countrymen for the freedom from yet another identity of slavery in this ‘Amrit Kaal’ of independence.
At the time of slavery, there was a statue of the representative of the British Raj.
Today the country has also established the life of a modern and strong India by installing the statue of Netaji at the same place.
But unfortunately, this great hero was forgotten after independence.
Mahakavi Bharathiyar wrote a very beautiful poem in Tamil language about the greatness of India.
The meaning of his poem is that our country India is the greatest
In knowledge, spirituality, dignity, food donation, music and eternal poems in the whole world, our country India is the greatest in the whole world.
We have to build the great India which Bharathiyar has described in his poem.
"Now our journey till the 100th year of independence is to mold our agriculture according to the new needs and new challenges"
“We have to take our agriculture out of the lab of chemistry and connect it to the lab of nature.
When I talk about nature's laboratory, it is completely science-based”
“We need not only to re-learn the ancient knowledge of agriculture but also to sharpen it for modern times.“
In this direction, we have to do research afresh, mould ancient knowledge into the modern scientific frame”
“Those who will benefit the most from natural farming constitute about 80% of the farmers of the country”
"In this Amrit Mahotsav, at least one village of every panchayat must be associated with natural farming, we can make this effort"
Governor of Gujarat Shri Acharya Devvrat ji, Home and Cooperation Minister Shri Amit Bhai Shah, Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Narendra Singh Tomar ji, Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Bhai Patel ji, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath ji, All other dignitaries, my farmer brothers and sisters connected in thousands from every corner of the country, today is a very important day for the agriculture sector of the country.
I had urged the farmers from all over the country to join the National Conclave of Natural Farming.
And as Agriculture Minister Tomar ji has just told, about 8 crore farmers are connected with us from every corner of the country through technology.
I welcome ,and congratulate all the farmer brothers and sisters.
I also greet Acharya Devvrat ji from the bottom of my heart.
I was listening to him very attentively like a student.
The farmers of our country will never underestimate and disregard what he said about their benefits.
This conclave is happening in Gujarat but its scope and impact is for every farmer of India.
Be it different dimensions of agriculture, be it food processing, natural farming, these topics will help a lot in rejuvenating Indian agriculture in the 21st century.
Agreements worth thousands of crores of rupees were discussed during this conclave and there has been progress also.
In these too, the enthusiasm shown for ethanol, organic farming and food processing opens up new possibilities.
I am also satisfied that the experiments of synergy between technology and natural farming in Gujarat are showing the direction to the entire country.
I once again want to express special gratitude to the Governor of Gujarat, Acharya Devvrat ji, who shared his experiences and explained in great detail to the farmers of the country about natural farming in a very coherent way.
In the nectar festival of freedom, today is the time to observe the past and learn from their experiences to pave new ways.
.We all have seen very closely the way agriculture has progressed, in the country in the decades after independence.
In the last 6-7 years, from seed to market, several steps have been taken one after the other to increase the income of the farmer.
And Shriman Tomar ji has also made some mention of this in his speech.
Along with agriculture, farmers are constantly being connected with many alternative sources of income like animal husbandry, beekeeping, fisheries, solar energy and bio-fuels.
Before the problems related to agriculture become huge, this is the right time to take big steps before that.
We just have to increase the amount of those bacteria in the earth, which increases its fertile power.
Everything from seed to soil can be treated in a natural way.
This farming costs neither fertilizer nor pesticide.
It also requires less irrigation and is also capable of dealing with floods -droughts.
Whether it is less irrigated land or land with extra water, natural farming allows the farmers to sow many crops in a year.
The more modern the world is becoming, the more it is moving towards 'back to basic'.
What is the meaning of this ‘back to basic’?
It means connecting with your roots!
Who understands this better than farmer friends?
The more we water the roots, the more the plant grows.
India is an agricultural country.
Our society has developed around farming, traditions have been nurtured, festivals have been created.
Today farmer friends are connected from every corner of the country.
When our civilization has flourished so much with agriculture, then how rich and scientific our knowledge and science must have been regarding agriculture?
We need not only to re-learn this ancient knowledge of agriculture, but also to sharpen it for modern times.
In this direction, institutions like our ICAR, Krishi Vigyan Kendras and agricultural universities can play a big role.
We do not have to limit the information to research papers and theories only, but we have to convert it into practical success.
When you will show that it is possible with success, then ordinary human beings will also connect with it as soon as possible.
Along with learning new things, we also have to forget the mistakes that have come in the way of farming.
Similarly, a misconception has also arisen that without chemical the crop will not be good.
Earlier there were no chemicals, but the crop was good.
History of the development of humanity is witness to this.
Despite all the challenges, humanity flourished the fastest in the agricultural era, moved forward.
Today, in the industrial age, we have the power of technology, there are so many resources, we even know the weather!
Now we farmers together can create a new history.
At a time when the world is concerned about global warming, Indian farmers can provide a solution through their traditional knowledge.
Together we can do something.
In this virtuous period, India has to give the best solution to the world regarding food security and harmony with nature.
At the Climate Change Summit, I called upon the world to make Lifestyle for Environment i. e. LIFE a global mission.
Today the country has cherished the dream of a self-reliant India.
PM unveils 30-feet tall bronze statue of Alluri Sitarama Raju
“Freedom struggle is not just a history of a few years, few areas, or of a few people”
“Alluri Sitarama Raju is a symbol of India’s culture, tribal identity, valour, ideals and values”
“Andhra Pradesh is the land of heroes and patriots”
Joining us in this historic event are the Governor of Andhra Pradesh Shri Biswa Bhushan Harichandan ji, Chief Minister Shri Jagan Mohan Reddy ji, my colleagues in the Union Cabinet, all other dignitaries present on the dais and my dear brothers and sisters of Andhra Pradesh,
Today, on one hand, the country is celebrating the 'Amrit Mahotsav' for 75 years of independence, while on the other hand it's the 125th birth anniversary of Alluri Sitaram Raju Garu.
Co-incidentally, at the same time 100 years of the "Rampa Revolution" for the country's freedom are also being completed.
The 125th birth anniversary of Alluri Sitarama Raju Garu and the 100th anniversary of the Rampa revolution will be celebrated throughout the year.
During the 'Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav', we all have pledged to ensure that the country is familiarized with the history of its freedom struggle and its inspirations.
The freedom struggle is not just the history of a few years, of a few areas, or of a few people.
This history is the history of sacrifice, penance and sacrifices of every corner and every particle of India.
The history of our freedom movement is the symbol of our strength of diversity, cultural power and our solidarity as a nation.
Alluri Sitarama Raju Garu embodies India's cultural and tribal identity, India's bravery, ideals and values.
Sitaram Raju Garu is a symbol of the ideology of 'Ek Bharat, Shrestha Bharat' which has been uniting this country for thousands of years.
Today, this is the best opportunity for the youth of today to come forward to fulfil the dreams of New India.
Today there are new opportunities in the country and new dimensions are opening up.
Today, it is the responsibility of all of us countrymen to fulfill the dreams of these fighters in Amritkal.
In the last eight years, the country has also made policies to fulfil this resolve, and has also worked with complete devotion.
Countless efforts are being made in the Amrit Mahotsav to make the unique contribution of the tribal society in the fight for freedom reach every household.
For the first time since independence, tribal museums are being set up to showcase the tribal pride and heritage of the country.
The “Alluri Sitarama Raju Memorial Tribal Freedom Fighters Museum” is also being built at Lambasingi, Andhra Pradesh.
"Vocal for Local" is making tribal artefacts a source of income.
I thank you all very much from the bottom of my heart.
"There are many important provisions in the budget for self-reliant India and Make in India"
“Positive factors like demographic dividend of young and talented population, democratic set up, natural resources should encourage us to move towards Make in India with determination”
Self-reliance is even more important if we look at it from the prism of national security”
“The world is looking at India as a manufacturing powerhouse”
“Take pride in the products your company makes and instil this sense of pride in your Indian customers as well”
“You will have to maintain global standards and you will also have to outdo the competition globally"
Take pride in the products your company makes and inspire people to be proud of them too.
We should develop our mills in advance by studying its market in the world and work for maximum production and its packaging.
The budget has also focused on developing new railway logistics for farmers, large-scale industries and MSMEs.
The integration of postal and railway networks will solve the problems of small enterprises and connectivity in remote areas.
The reform in the Special Economic Zone Act will give a great boost to our exports, and the ‘Make in India’ will be strengthened.
Many of our PLI schemes are currently in a very crucial stage of implementation.
The Prime Minister interacted with District Magistrates of over 40 districts in Jharkhand, Manipur, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, and other States having low vaccination coverage
“You will have to do your best to take your districts nearer the national average”
The issues that you put forth and the experiences that you shared are very important.
I can see that you also have the same spirit that your state, district and locality should be free from this crisis as soon as possible.
My colleagues in the Union Cabinet, all the dignitaries associated with education, skill development, science, technology and research, and ladies and gentlemen,
Universalization of Quality Education: Important decisions have been made to expand our education system, improve its quality and increase the capacity of the education sector.
This year’s budget will go a long way in implementing the new National Education Policy.
We are witnessing the rapid decline in the digital divide in India.
Therefore, educational infrastructure like e-Vidya, One Class One Channel, Digital Labs and Digital University is going to help the youth a lot.
This is an attempt to provide better solutions for education to all, be it villages, poor, Dalit, backward, tribal community, in the socio-economic setup of India.
Today is also World Mother Language Day.
Education in the mother tongue is linked to the mental development of children.
Medical and technical education in local languages has been started in many states.
Work has to be done to make the E-content accessible in Indian languages to all through Internet, mobile phone, TV and radio.
The popular Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Shri Yogi Adityanath ji, my cabinet colleague Shri Parshottam Rupala ji, other ministers, MPs, President of International Dairy Federation P. Brazzale ji, DG of IDF Caroline Emond ji, other dignitaries present here, ladies and gentlemen!
I am glad that today experts and innovators in the dairy sector from across the world have congregated in India.
The potential of the dairy sector not only fuels the rural economy, but it is also a major source of livelihood for crores of people around the world.
Livestock and milk business have been an integral part of India's culture dating back thousands of years.
This legacy of ours has empowered the dairy sector of India with certain characteristics.
Unlike other developed countries of the world, the small farmers are the driving force of the dairy sector in India.
Due to the hard work of these small farmers and their livestock, today India is the largest milk producing country in the whole world.
Today this sector provides employment to more than 8 crore families in India.
You will rarely find such uniqueness of the Indian dairy sector anywhere else.
There is no middle man in the whole process, and more than 70 percent of the money received from the customers goes directly into the pockets of the farmers.
Now, due to the digital revolution happening in India, most of the transactions in the dairy sector are taking place at a very fast pace.
Be it animal vaccination or other technology, India has always been ready to contribute to the dairy sector of the whole world and learn from all its partner countries.
I invite the global leaders of the dairy industry to join the drive to empower the dairy sector in India.
“Retail Direct Scheme will give strength to the inclusion of everyone in the economy as it will bring in the middle class, working class, small businessmen and senior citizens with their small savings directly and securely in government securities”
“Due to government’s measures, the governance of banks is improving and the trust in this system is getting stronger among the depositors”
“The decisions of the RBI also helped in enhancing the impact of the big decisions that the government has taken in recent times”
“Till 6-7 years ago, banking, pension and insurance, used to be like an exclusive club in India”
This period of Amrit Mahotsav and this important decade of the 21st century is of great importance for the development of the country.
Therefore, the RBI has a very big and important role to play.
I am confident that Team RBI will live up to the expectations of the country.
For the past 6-7 years, the Central Government has been prioritizing the interests of the common man.
RBI, as a regulator, maintains constant communication with other financial institutions.
I am glad that RBI has also taken several steps to improve the convenience of the common man.
It will help in resolution of every complaint and problem of the bank customers on time and without any hassle.
The Retail Direct Scheme is going to give new heights to the spirit of promoting everyone's participation in the economy.
People are generally aware of the important role of the Government Securities Market in the development of the country.
Till now, our middle class, working class, small traders, senior citizens i. e. those who have small savings had to take indirect avenues like banks, insurance or mutual funds to invest in the government securities.
Now they are getting another great option of safe investment.
You also know that all government securities in India have a provision for guaranteed settlement.
In this case, small investors get an assurance of safety.
This is the collective power and effort of the citizens and the government to build a self-reliant India.
You experts are well aware of all these things, but it will help the common people of the country a lot if they are also informed.
This account can be opened online and people can also trade securities online.
You can imagine the convenience it will result in for people.
A strong banking system is very important for a strong economy.
It has not only led to improvement in the governance of these banks but the trust of the millions of depositors is also getting stronger in the system.
In the recent past, many decisions have been taken keeping in view the interests of the depositors.
For example, if someone had a bank account in Lucknow and he was working in Delhi.
But now he has got the facility to register his complaint from anywhere in India.
This will ensure better coordination between the banks and the investigating agencies in the shortest possible time.
A special campaign was launched by the government to give Kisan Credit Cards to small farmers during the Covid period itself.
Under it, more than 2.5 crore farmers also got KCC cards and they also got agriculture loans of about 2.75 lakh crores.
This scheme has also linked them to the banking system.
Many such interventions have played a very important role in restarting economic activities in villages and cities.
Till six-seven years ago, banking, pension, insurance, etc. used to be like an exclusive club in India.
All these facilities were far away for the common citizens, poor families, farmers, small traders and businessmen, women, Dalits-deprived-backwards.
Today, not only the financial inclusion, the ease of access is becoming the identity of India in the banking and financial sector.
About 38 crore countrymen have the insurance cover of Rs 2 lakh each under the PM Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana and the PM Suraksha Bima Yojana.
Almost every village in the country has the facility of a bank branch or a banking correspondent within a radius of 5 km.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, more than 42 crore zero balance bank accounts were opened, in which thousands of crores of rupees are deposited today.
Today, our banking system is operational 24 hours, 7 days and 12 months anytime, anywhere in the country.
It is a great strength of the country when the RBI is a sensitive regulator and keeps itself prepared for the changing circumstances.
Technology is changing rapidly in this field.
In such a situation, it is necessary that our regulating systems remain alert to these changes and create a suitable and empowering ecosystem to keep our financial systems world class.
Once again, I wish all the very best to all the stakeholders for the initiatives and technological innovations for these massive reforms.
Women of the region presented a huge Rakhi to PM thanking him for all that he has done for the dignity and ease of living of women
“Meaningful results are realized when the government sincerely reaches out to the beneficiary with a resolve”
8 years of the Government have been devoted to ‘Seva Sushasan aur Garib Kalyan’
I am happy that Bharuch district has taken a big initiative.
Rarely does humanity face such occasions when the cycle of time gives us a chance to rectify the past and build a new future.
Fortunately, there is one such moment before us today.
Today, we have got an opportunity to reconnect the age-old link of biodiversity that was broken decades ago and had become extinct.
Today the cheetahs have returned to the soil of India.
In particular, I also thank our friendly country Namibia and its government with whose cooperation the cheetahs have returned to Indian soil after several decades.
I am sure these cheetahs will not only make us aware of our responsibilities towards nature, but will also make us aware of our human values and traditions.
In the last centuries, we have also seen the time when the exploitation of nature was considered a symbol of power and modernity.
When only the last three cheetahs were left in the country in 1947, they too were hunted mercilessly and irresponsibly in the Saal forests.
Now the country is committed to rehabilitate cheetahs with new energy in the ‘Amrit Kaal’ of independence.
I am glad that this ‘amrit’ of duty and faith is reviving our legacy, heritage and now cheetahs also on the soil of India in the ‘Amrit Kaal’ of independence.
Our scientists carried out extensive research by working closely with South African and Namibian experts.
And today, our hard work is in front of us as a result.
It is true that our future is secure when nature and the environment are protected.
The avenues for growth and prosperity also open up.
When cheetahs sprint again in Kuno National Park, the grassland eco-system will be restored and bio-diversity will improve further.
In the coming days, eco-tourism will also pick up here, new possibilities of development will arise here and employment opportunities will increase.
The countrymen will have to show patience and wait for a few months to see the cheetahs released in the Kuno National Park.
We must not allow our efforts to fail.
Today, the world talks about sustainable development when it looks at nature and environment.
We are taught to care about even the smallest creatures living around us.
Then how can we tolerate if the existence of an entire species is lost because of us?
Today, cheetahs are found in some countries of Africa and in Iran, but India was put off that list long ago.
Children will not have to go through this irony in the near future.
I am sure they will be able to see the cheetahs sprinting in their own country in Kuno National Park.
Today, 21st century India is giving a message to the whole world that economy and ecology are not conflicting against each other.
Since the formation of our government in 2014, about 250 new protected areas have been added in the country.
There has also been a significant increase in the number of Asiatic lions here.
Today Gujarat has emerged as an important habitat of ​​Asiatic lions in the country.
Decades of hard work, research-based policies and public participation have a big role behind this.
I remember, we took a pledge in Gujarat – ‘We will improve respect for wild animals and reduce conflict’.
We have also achieved the target of doubling the number of tigers in the country ahead of time.
Not only in India, the life and needs of crores of people all over the world depend on wetland ecology.
The impact of these efforts of the country will be visible for centuries to come and will pave new paths for progress.
I am sure that India's efforts and traditions will guide the entire humanity in this direction and give strength to the dream of a better world.
“The North East, which Netaji called the gateway to India's independence, is becoming the gateway to fulfilling the dreams of a new India”
“We are working to realise the possibilities in the North East”
“Today the youth of the country are taking inspiration from the players of Manipur”
“From a ‘blockade state’ , Manipur has become a state promoting international trade”
“We also have to maintain stability in Manipur and take Manipur to new heights of development; Only the double engine government can do this work”
A few days from now, on January 21, it will be the 50th anniversary of Manipur getting statehood.
The country is also celebrating Amrit Mahotsav on the 75th anniversary of its independence.
I have said earlier also that the eastern part of the country, the North East, will be the major source of India's development.
Today we can see how Manipur and the North East are adding new colors to the future of India.
This is the miracle of the strength of your one vote that about 80,000 houses have been sanctioned under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.
I visited Manipur many times before I became Prime Minister.
Therefore, I brought the entire Delhi, the Government of India, to your doorsteps after 2014.
Today, the seven years of our government’s hard work is visible all over the North East and in Manipur.
Today, Manipur is becoming a symbol of change, a symbol of new work culture.
But we have embarked on the 'Act East' policy for the North East.
God has given this region so many natural resources, so much potential.
These possibilities of the North East are now being taken care of.
The North East is now becoming the gateway to India's development.
Manipur has been one of the rare gem states in the country.
The youth, especially the daughters of Manipur, have made the country proud everywhere in the world.
Our government has also entered into historic agreements which were awaited for decades.
From ‘blockade state’, Manipur is paving the way for international trade.
And this can only be done by the double engine government.
On behalf of 130 crore Indians, I convey my greetings to the dignitaries from all over the world gathered at the World Economic Forum.
Today when I am talking to you, India is tackling another Corona wave with caution and alertness.
Today, India is filled with the excitement of the celebrations of 75 years of its independence and also with the confidence of having administered 160 crore corona vaccine doses in just one year.
During the Corona time, we have seen how India, following the vision of 'One Earth, One Health', is saving crores of lives by providing necessary medicines and vaccines to many countries.
Today India is the world's third largest pharma producer; it’s a pharmacy to the world.
The digital infrastructure that India has developed and adopted over the years has become a huge strength of India today.
We are constantly trying to overcome all the challenges.
India has made its corporate tax the most competitive in the world by simplifying and reducing it.
Last year alone, we have eliminated more than 25 thousand compliances.
India has also deregulated many sectors like Drones, Space, Geo-spatial mapping.
India has made major reforms in the outdated telecom regulations related to IT sector and BPO.
In the midst of these efforts, we also have to recognize that our lifestyle is also a big challenge for the climate.
Therefore, it is important to transform Mission LIFE into a global mass movement.
I am sure there will be a positive dialogue in this direction during the discussions in Davos.
In the midst of new challenges, the world today needs new avenues, new resolutions.
Today, every country in the world needs cooperation with each other more than ever before.
This is the way to a better future.
I am sure this discussion in Davos will expand this spirit.
“Meghalaya has given the message of nature and progress, conservation and eco-sustainability to the world”
“The country has high hopes from the rich sports culture of Meghalaya”
Many congratulations to all the people of Meghalaya on the golden jubilee celebration of the statehood!
Today, I applaud everyone who has contributed to the building and development of Meghalaya.
It was an unforgettable experience as a Prime Minister to participate in this event in Shillong after a gap of three-four decades.
Meghalaya has given the message of nature and progress, conservation and eco-sustainability to the world.
The central government is fully committed especially to better road, rail and air connectivity.
Apart from tourism and organic farming, efforts are also needed for the development of new sectors in Meghalaya.
My heartiest congratulations and best wishes to all my friends, journalists, staff and readers associated with the powerful voice of North East in Assamese language, Agradoot, on 50 years i. e. five decades of golden journey!
In the 75th year of independence, the golden jubilee celebrations of the Dainik Agradoot is not only reaching a milestone, but is also an inspiration for journalism and national duty in the 'Azadi Ka AmritKaal'.
Normal life has been seriously disrupted in many districts of Assam.
Himanta ji and his team are working hard day and night for relief and rescue operation.
Today, I assure the people of Assam and the readers of Agradoot that the Central and State Governments are working together to bring them out of their difficulties.
Even today, this kind of journalism is doing a great service in connecting the common man with the government.
The theme for Digital India Week 2022 is 'Catalyzing New India’s Technology'
“India is guiding the world in the fourth industrial revolution, Industry 4.0”
“India has removed so many lines by getting online”
“Digital India has brought the government to the doorsteps and phones of the citizens”
Today, India is working on the target of taking electronic manufacturing to more than $ 300 billion in the next three-four years.
“India wants to become a chip maker from a chip taker.
Namste,Chief Minister of Gujarat Shri Bhupendrabhai Patel ji, my colleagues in the Union Council of Ministers Shri Ashwini Vaishnaw ji and Shri Rajeev Chandrasekhar ji, all the representatives from different states, all the beneficiaries of Digital India, all the partners associated with start-ups and industry , experts, academicians, researchers, ladies and gentlemen!
Today's program is a glimpse of India becoming increasingly modern in the 21st century.
India has exemplified before the world how revolutionary the use of technology is for the entire humanity in the form of the Digital India campaign.
I am glad that this campaign, which began eight years ago, has been expanding with the changing times.
Every year new dimensions are added to the Digital India campaign, and new technologies are incorporated.
As you saw in small-smalll videos, be it myScheme, Bhashini-Bhashadaan, Digital India - Genesis, Chips to startup program, or all other products, all these are going to strengthen Ease of Living and Ease of Doing Business.
In particular, It will be of great benefit to the start-up ecosystem of India.
But today we can proudly say that India is the fourth industrial revolution, Industry 4.0, today India can proudly say that India is giving direction to the world.
One of the greatest achievements of the Digital India campaign is that it has bridged the gap between cities and villages.
Nobody could imagine that the gap between villages and cities would be bridged one day.
More than four lakh new Common Service Centers have been added in the villages to provide hundreds of government services digitally in the last eight years.
Today, the people of the villages are taking advantage of Digital India from these centres.
I wish you all the very best for this Digital India Week.
I also congratulate the departments for organizing this wonderful program in Gujarat.
With the belief that it will become an inspiration for the youth of the country, many best wishes to you all.
The DG WHO commends the Prime Minister and Indian government for harnessing the power of innovation in public health
“Your championing will bring significant change in the use of traditional medicines”, DG tells the Prime Minister
PM gives a Gujarati name ‘Tulsi Bhai’ to Dr.Tedros Ghebreyesus
“The possibilities of investment and innovation in the field of AYUSH are limitless”
“AYUSH sector has increased to more than $18 billion from less than $3 billion in 2014”
“India is a treasure trove of herbal plants, it is, in a way our 'Green Gold'”
“More than 50 MoUs with different countries have been formalized in the last few years.
Hon'ble Prime Minister of Mauritius Pravind Jagannath ji, Director General of WHO Dr Tedros, zealous Chief Minister of Gujarat Shri Bhupendra Bhai Patel, my Cabinet colleagues Sarbananda Sonowal ji, Mansukh Bhai Mandaviya ji, Mahendra Bhai Munjapara ji, all the diplomats, scientists, entrepreneurs and experts from the country and abroad, ladies and gentlemen!
I warmly welcome all of you to the Global Ayush Investment and Innovation Summit.
We have often seen that investment summits have been held for investing in different sectors and Gujarat in particular has carried on this tradition at a massive scale.
But for the very first time, such an investment summit is being held exclusively for the AYUSH sector.
During this period we have also seen that the modern pharma companies and vaccine manufacturers could do a commendable job when the investment was received at the right time.
Innovation and investment increase the potential of any sector manifold.
Now the time has come to increase the investment in the AYUSH sector as much as possible.
The possibilities of investment and innovation in the field of AYUSH are limitless.
As the demand for AYUSH products is increasing all over the world, this growth will increase further in the coming years.
Be it nutritional supplements, supply chain management of medicines, AYUSH-based diagnostic tools, or telemedicine, there are new opportunities for investment and innovation everywhere.
A few days back an incubation centre developed by All India Institute of Ayurveda has been inaugurated.
In a way, this is the era of unicorns in India.
I am sure unicorns will also emerge from our AYUSH based start-ups very soon.
Production of herbs and medicinal plants can be a good means of increasing the income and livelihood of the farmers.
This will open a huge export market for AYUSH in more than 150 countries.
Greetings from India to all Israeli friends and Shalom.
Today is a special day in our relationship.
30 years ago, on this very day, full diplomatic relations were established between us.
A new chapter began between the two countries.
Even though this chapter was new, the history of both our countries is very old.
As is the nature of India, for hundreds of years our Jewish community has lived and flourished in a harmonious environment in Indian society without any discrimination.
It has made significant contributions to our development journey.
On this important milestone of 30 years, I congratulate you all again.
I am sure that India-Israel friendship will continue to set new records of mutual cooperation in the coming decades.
“Be it the Anglo-Abor war or the security of the border after independence, the tales of valour of the people of Arunachal are a priceless heritage for every Indian”
“Eastern India, specially North-Eastern India will be the engine of India’s development in 21st century”
“We are working with full force to make Arunachal a major gateway to East Asia.
Considering the role of Arunachal Pradesh in terms of national security, modern infrastructure is also being developed.
My brothers and sisters of Arunachal Pradesh!
Many congratulations to all of you on the 36th (thirty-sixth) Statehood Day of Arunachal Pradesh.
50 years ago, NEFA received a new name, a new identity in the form of 'Arunachal Pradesh'.
The identity of this rising Sun and this new vitality have been relentlessly strengthened in these 50 years by all you diligent and patriotic sisters and brothers.
That is why I too wish to use a few lines of this song while talking to you.
The way Arunachal Pradesh has given a new height to the spirit of patriotism and social harmony, the way Arunachal Pradesh has cherished and upheld its cultural heritage, the way you are carrying your traditions and development hand in hand, is an inspiration to the entire nation.
On the occasion of Azaadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, the country is commemorating all those martyrs of Arunachal Pradesh who had sacrificed their lives for the nation.
Whether it is the Anglo-Abor War or the security of the border after independence, the tales of the valour of the people of Arunachal are invaluable heritage for every Indian.
It is my firm belief that East India, especially Northeast India will become the engine of development for the country in the 21st century.
With this spirit, unprecedented work has been done in the last seven years to accelerate the development of Arunachal Pradesh.
Whenever I speak to the Law Minister of the country, Shri Kiren Rijijuji, he always comes up with new ideas and suggestions to take Arunachal Pradesh forward.
You have made nature a part of your life.
We are striving to take the tourism potential of Arunachal to the whole world.
First of all, I extend a warm welcome to Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his delegation to India.
This may be his first visit to India as Prime Minister, but as an old friend of India, he knows and understands India very well.
In the last few months, India has concluded Free Trade Agreements with UAE and Australia.
At the same pace, with the same commitment, we would like to move forward on the FTA with the UK as well.
We have also agreed to enhance cooperation in the defence sector.
We welcome the UK's support for ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ in all sectors of manufacturing, technology, design and development in the defence sector.
1.6 million people of Indian origin living in the UK are making positive contributions to the society and every sector of the economy.
And we want to strengthen this living bridge further.
Prime Minister Johnson has personally contributed a lot in this direction.
I congratulate him for this.
Today 10 crore rural households of the country have been connected with piped clean water facility.
Today Goa has become the first Har Ghar Jal certified state in the country where every household is connected to piped water.
Now more than one lakh villages of different states of the country have become ODF plus.
“There cannot be a better beginning of AmritKaal”
“Those who do not care about the country, are not bothered about spoiling the present or future of the country.
Within just three years, seven crore rural households have been connected with piped water facilities under the Jal Jeevan Mission.
“This is an example of the same human-centred development, which I talked about this time from the Red Fort”
Namaskar, Chief Minister of Goa Shri Pramod Sawant ji, Union Minister of Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat ji, other Ministers of the Government of Goa, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, today is a very important and holy day.
Shri Krishna Janmashtami is being celebrated across the country.
Many congratulations to all the countrymen and the devotees of Lord Shri Krishna spread all over the world.
But today I want to share three big achievements of the country with all the citizens.
Today we have crossed three important milestones related to the huge goals that India is working on in the ‘Amrit Kaal’.
The country and especially Goa has achieved a milestone today.
The third achievement of the country is related to Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
A few years ago, the country was declared open defecation free with the efforts of all the countrymen.
Today, major organizations of the world are saying that one of the biggest challenges of the 21st century will be water security.
Common human beings, poor, middle class, farmers and industries, everyone suffers without water.
To deal with this big challenge, there is a need to work round the clock with a sense of service and duty.
I have full faith that the way the whole country is working hard we will definitely achieve the goal of water for every household.
“This is New India, which does not hold back from innovating.
Present in the program are our colleagues from the Council of Ministers, Smriti Irani, Dr. Mahendrabhai, all the officers, all the parents and teachers, and all my young friends who are the future of India!
Once again, many congratulations to all of you for these awards.
I also congratulate and extend my best wishes to all the daughters of the country.
The country is currently celebrating 75 years of its independence.
Similarly, our daughters are doing wonders in the fields where they were not allowed earlier.
“Resilience and unity of the Manipuri people in the face of ups and downs of their history is their true strength”
“Government is committed to make Manipur the sports powerhouse of the country”
“Manipur has a key role in the vision of making the North-East the center of Act East policy”
Many congratulations to the people of Manipur on the completion of 50 years of formation!
It is the perseverance and sacrifice of so many people behind the achievements of Manipur as a state today.
I respectfully bow down to every such person.
Manipur has seen many ups and downs in the last 50 years.
The people of Manipur have lived every moment unitedly and faced every situation.
This is the true strength of Manipur.
It has been my constant endeavor over the last seven years to come among you and take a first-hand account of your expectations, aspirations and needs.
This is also the reason why I was able to understand your expectations and feelings better and find new ways to solve your problems.
Today development is reaching every region and section of Manipur without any discrimination.
It is a matter of great satisfaction for me personally.
Keeping in view the potential of the youth of Manipur, we have taken the initiative to make the state a sports powerhouse of the country.
This is the reasoning behind the establishment of the country's first National Sports University.
This is a great effort to promote sports, sports education, sports management and technology.
Not only sports, the youth of Manipur are doing wonders in the matter of start-ups and entrepreneurship also.
In this too, the role of sisters and daughters is commendable.
Manipur's role is important in the vision with which we are moving forward to make the North East the center of the Act East Policy.
You had to wait 50 years for the first passenger train.
It took decades for such a basic facility.
But now, work is happening at a rapid pace for the connectivity in Manipur.
Today, work is going on at a brisk pace on connectivity projects worth thousands of crores of rupees.
Similarly, with Imphal airport getting international status, connectivity of North-Eastern states with Delhi, Kolkata and Bengaluru has improved.
Work is also going on in full swing on the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway.
Manipur has started the journey towards rapid development.
Now we have to walk with new dreams and new resolutions for the next decade.
I am very assured about your bright future.
Manipur has to move ahead at a fast pace with a double engine of development.
With 2.4% of the world's land area, India accounts for nearly 8% of the world's species.
The Aravalli Biodiversity Park in Haryana has been declared as an O. E. C. M. site for its effective conservation of biodiversity.
Since 2015,we have restored more than 11.5 million hectares.
Through the International Solar Alliance, our aim is ''One Sun, One World, One Grid''.
Let me begin by conveying Pongal and Makar Sankranti greetings to you all.
Thus, we are furthering the health of our society and making the connect with our culture stronger.
Medical education is one of the most desired streams for studies.
The problem of shortage of doctors in India was well-known.
But there were not enough efforts to address this problem.
In 2014, our country had 387 medical colleges.
This is an increase of 54 percent.
In last seven years, this number has gone up to around 1 lakh 48 thousand seats.
This is a significant increase of about 80 percent.
In 2014, there were only seven AIIMS in the country.
But after 2014, the number of AIIMS approved has increased to twenty two.
At the same time, various reforms have been under-taken to make the medical education sector more transparent.
Regulations for setting up medical colleges and hospitals have been liberalised without compromising on quality.
I am told that this would be the first time that 11 medical colleges are being inaugurated at one stroke located in any one State.
Just few days back, I had inaugurated 9 medical collegesat the same time in Uttar Pradesh.
So, I am getting to break my own record.
It is important to address regional imbalances.
In that light, it is good to see 2 of the medical colleges inaugurated are in the aspirational districts of Ramanathapuram and Virudhunagar.
These are districts where the development needs require special attention.
One college is in the remote hilly district of the Nilgiris.
The new building of the Central Institute of Classical Tamil will make Tamil studies more popular.
It will also give a wider canvas to students and researchers.
I am told that the Central Institute of Classical Tamil intends to translate Tirukkural in various Indian and foreign languages.
One of the happiest moments of my life was when I got a chance to speak a few words in the world's oldest language, Tamil, at the United Nations.
The Sangam classics are our window to the rich society and culture of the ancient times.
Located in my Parliamentary constituency, this will drive greater curiosity about Tamil.
We have given great emphasis on promotion of Indian languages and Indian Knowledge Systems in our National Education Policy 2020.
Tamil can now be studied as a classical language in school education at the secondary level or middle level.
Largest e-content of Tamil has been digitized under the Bharatavani project.
We are encouraging education in mother tongue and local languages at schools.
Our Governmenthas also started making technical courses like Engineering available to students in Indian languages.
Tamil Nadu has produced many bright Engineers.
Many of them have become top global technology and business leaders.
I call upon this talented Tamil diaspora to help develop Tamil language content in STEM courses.
We are also developing an Artificial intelligence based language translation tool to translate English language online courses into twelve different Indian languages including Tamil.
India's diversity is our strength.
When children from Tamil Nadu or Kerala learn about Veer Baal Divas, they get connected with the life and message of the Sahibzades.
The great sons of this soil who sacrificed their lives but never compromised on their ideals.
Let us make efforts to discover other cultures.
I assure you that you will enjoy it.
India's vaccination drive is making remarkable progress.
The precaution dose for the elderly and healthcare workers have begun too.
Learning from the pandemic we keep working to ensure inclusive and quality healthcare services to all our countrymen.
We need to learn from our rich culture and build the foundations of Amrit Kaal for the future generations to come.
Best wishes once again to all on the occasion of Pongal.
May it bring peace and prosperity to all of us.
My Friend Boris, Thank You for giving me the opportunity to present my views on the important issue of adaptation!
This is an injustice to developing countries, which are more affected by climate change.
From drinking water sources to affordable housing, all of these need to be made resilient against climate change.
I have three views in this context.
First, we have to make adaptation a key part of our development policies and projects.
Projects like ‘Nal se Jal’- Tap water for all, ‘Swachh Bharat’- clean India Mission and ‘Ujjwala’- clean cooking fuel for all in India, have not only provided adaptation benefits to our needy citizens but have also improved their quality of life.
Secondly, many traditional communities have adequate knowledge of living in harmony with nature.
These traditional practices must be given due importance in our adaptation policies.
This flow of knowledge must also be included in the school syllabus so that it is passed on to the new generation.
Third, the methods of adaptation may be local, but backward countries should get global support for them.
With the idea of global support for local adaptation, India had taken the initiative of Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure CDRI.
I request all countries to join this initiative.
“Sustainable growth is possible only through sustainable energy sources”
“Whatever targets India has set for itself, I do not see them as a challenges but as opportunity”
“Budget announcement of 19.5 thousand crore rupees for high-efficiency solar module manufacturing which will help in making India a global hub for manufacturing and Research & Development of solar modules and related products”
“Provisions have also been made in this year's budget regarding battery swapping policy and inter-operability standards.
These will reduce the problems faced in the use of electric vehicles in India”
“World is witnessing depletion of all types of natural resources.
In such a scenario, circular economy is the demand of the hour and we have to make it a mandatory part of our lives”
'Energy for Sustainable Growth' is inspired by our ancient traditions and is also the means to fulfill the needs and aspirations of the future.
India has a clear vision that sustainable growth is possible only through sustainable energy sources.
In this year’s budget, 19,500 crore rupees have been announced for high-efficiency solar module manufacturing in the direction of solar energy.
Manufacturing of energy-efficient products should be our priority wherever the consumption of electricity is high.
Our government increased the production of LED bulbs and naturally its prices came down to Rs 70-80.
We distributed about 37 crore LED bulbs in the country under the Ujala scheme.
As a result, about forty-eight thousand million kilowatt hours of electricity have been saved.
Also, about 40 million tonnes of carbon emissions have been reduced annually.
In this year's budget, four pilot projects have been introduced for coal gasification which will strengthen technical and financial viability.
I think the industry needs to make innovative investments to utilize these possibilities.
The Governor of West Bengal, Shri Jagdeep Dhankhar ji, the Union Minister of Culture and Tourism, Shri Kishan Reddy ji, all the dignitaries associated with the Victoria Memorial Hall, Vice-Chancellors of the universities, stalwarts of the arts and culture, ladies and gentlemen!
First of all, I express my condolences on the violent incident in Birbhum, West Bengal.
I would also urge the people of Bengal to never forgive the perpetrators of such incidents and those who encourage such criminals.
On behalf of the Central Government, I also assure the State that the Government of India will provide whatever help it needs in getting the criminals punished at the earliest.
Such are the people who sacrifice for the country.
They continue to spread their fragrance generation after generation by becoming a flower of inspiration.
The stories of these heroes inspire all of us to work relentlessly for the country.
Bankim Babu's Vande Mataram has become the life mantra of Indians today.
Jhansi's Rani Lakshmibai, Jhalkari Bai, Kittur's Rani Chennamma, Matangini Hazra, Bina Das, Kamla Das Gupta, Kanaklata Barua, many such heroines ignited the flame of freedom struggle with women power.
In the memory of all such heroes, ‘Prabhat Pheris’ (mini processions) have been taken out at many places since this morning.
Our young friends have organized special programs in schools and colleges.
Today this place has been sanctified by the memories of many great fighters like Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Aurobindo Ghosh, Ras Bihari Bose, Khudi Ram Bose, Bagha Jatin, Binoy, Badal, Dinesh, etc.
Therefore, the country experiences its history, its past, as an awakened source of energy.
This new vision is of India's self-confidence, self-reliance, ancient identity and future progress.
.My colleagues in the Union Cabinet Piyush Goyal ji, Mansukh Mandaviya ji, Ashwini Vaishnav ji, Sarbananda Sonowal ji, Purushottam Rupala ji, G Kishan Reddy ji, Pashupati Kumar Paras ji, Jitendra Singh ji, Som Prakash ji, startups from all over the country All the veterans of the world, our young comrades, other dignitaries and brothers and sisters,
The ‘Start-up India Innovation Week’ event assumes greater significance in the 75th year of independence.
When India completes 100 years of its independence, your role in building that grand India is huge.
I congratulate all the start-ups and the innovative youth who are raising the flag of India in the world of start-ups.
This decade is being called the ‘Techade of India’.
There are three important aspects to the massive changes that the government is making in this decade to strengthen the innovation, entrepreneurship and start-up ecosystem.
Our endeavour is to institutionalize innovation in the country by creating an attraction for innovation among students since childhood.
More than 9,000 Atal Tinkering Labs are giving children a chance to innovate and work on new ideas in schools.
Where there were not even 500 startups in the country five years ago, today this number has increased to 60,000.
Today almost half the start-ups are operating from Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities.
Today lakhs of youth are getting employment in these start-ups.
The extra space available in GatiShakti projects can be used for building EV charging infrastructure.
Many investors of the country and abroad are investing in drone start-ups following the implementation of the new drone policy recently.
Drone companies have received orders worth about Rs 500 crore from the Army, Navy and Air Force.
So it has a lot of potentials.
This is a new era of innovation i. e. ideas, industry and investment.
“Our Vedas and tradition have given a call that women should be able and capable to give direction to the nation”
“Progress of women always gives strength to the empowerment of the nation”
All the dignitaries on stage, ladies and gentlemen present at the event and all the dignitaries from all over the world connected virtually!
I extend my warm greetings on the occasion of Prakash Parv to all of you, to all the countrymen and to the people all over the world who have faith in Guruvani.
During the 75 years after independence, several Indian dreams have resonated from here.
Therefore, this event, being held at the Red Fort during the 'Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav' has become all the more special.
India is not just a country, but is a great heritage and a great tradition for us.
India's Independence, India's freedom from several years of colonialism cannot be seen in isolation from India's spiritual and cultural journey.
Today we are the 5th largest economy in the world.
The country wants to move forward at the same speed
Today India is setting huge export targets, earlier deciding this was a difficult task.
In such a situation, the National Logistics Policy has brought a lot of new energy for every sector.
Therefore, this policy should not be seen just as a government document.
We have to realize these possibilities together.
Home Minister Shri Amit Shah ji, Member of Parliament Shri Nishikant Dubey ji, Home Secretary, Chief of Army Staff, Chief of Air Staff, DGP Jharkhand, DG NDRF, DG ITBP, staff from local administration, all the brave soldiers connected with us, Commandos, Police personnel, and all other companions,
For three days in a row you have worked round the clock and have successfully accomplished a difficult rescue operation that saved the lives of several countrymen.
The whole country has appreciated your valour.
Several companions have also been injured.
I wish all the injured a speedy recovery.
You were all at the spot.
But the country is proud that it has such a skilled force in the form of our Army, Air Force, NDRF jawans, ITBP personnel and police personnel, who have the capacity to bring the countrymen out of every crisis safely.
We have learnt several lessons from this crisis as well as this rescue mission.
Your experiences are going to be very useful in the future.
Your swiftness decides the success or failure of such operations.
A new hope awakens in them.
I once again thank you very much for your valour, effort and the compassion with which you have worked towards the people.
“Leaving the devastation caused by the earthquake behind, the people of Bhuj and Kutch are now writing a new destiny for the region with their hard work”
“Better health facilities are not limited to only treatment of disease, they also encourage social justice”
If the poor gets freedom from the worry of the cost of treatment, then he works harder to get out of poverty with ease.
Heartiest congratulations to the people of Kutch for such a big event related to health.
Today many modern medical services exist in this area.
This is going to come out as a guarantee of best treatment for the families of our soldiers and paramilitary forces as well as for the many people in the business world.
Better health facilities are not limited to the treatment of diseases only.
When a poor person gets access to cheap and best treatment, then his faith in the system gets stronger.
Crores of rupees are being saved every year in the treatment of poor and middle class families due to Ayushman Bharat Yojana and Jan Aushadhi Yojana.
Health and wellness centres, campaigns such as Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Scheme are helping to make treatment accessible to all.
Ayushman Bharat Digital Health Mission will further increase the facilities for the patients.
Modern and critical healthcare infrastructure is being extended to the district and block levels through the Ayushman Health Infrastructure Mission.
Today, besides dozens of AIIMS, many super speciality hospitals are also being built in the country.
My cabinet colleagues, my senior Parliamentary colleagues, respected colleagues from various political parties, other dignitaries, ladies and gentlemen!
Today festivals and celebrations are going on in different parts of the country.
Today's occasion has become even more special due to other reasons.
In these 75 years, the country has seen various proud moments.
Every Prime Minister of the country has tried to take the country forward by overcoming the different challenges of his/her time.
Everyone had a different personality, achievement and leadership.
If the people of the country especially the youth - the future generations know and learn about all the Prime Ministers, they will get inspired.
“This statue of Shivaji Maharaj, who resides in the heart of all of us, will awaken the spirit of patriotism in the younger generation”
“Pune has continuously strengthened its identity in the fields of Education, Research & Development, IT and Automobile.
“This Metro will ease mobility in Pune, give relief from pollution and jams, increase the ease of living of the people of Pune”
“In today's fast growing India, we have to focus on speed and also on scale.
That is why our government has formulated the PM-Gatishakti National Master Plan.
Presently the country is celebrating 'Azaadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav' marking 75 years of independence.
Pune has a historical contribution in the independence of India.
Sometime back I got the privilege of inaugurating the grand statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.
Today several other projects related to the development of Pune have either been inaugurated or their foundation stones are being laid.
Earlier, when the foundation stones used to be laid, nobody knew when the inauguration would take place.
This event is important because it also carries a message that plans can be completed on time.
Pune has been famous for its cultural, spiritual and patriotic consciousness.
And at the same time, Pune has continuously strengthened its identity in the field of Education, Research and Development, IT and Automobile.
You are all well aware of how fast urbanisation is taking place in our country.
It is believed that by 2030 our urban population will cross 60 crore.
In 21st century India, we also have to modernise our cities and add new facilities to them.
Keeping in mind the futuristic city of India, our government is working simultaneously on several projects.
In order to improve the drinking water and drainage conditions in the cities, we are taking various initiatives under the AMRUT Mission.
We are focusing on biofuel, on ethanol, to get rid of pollution, to reduce foreign dependence on crude oil, and to increase farmers' income.
The central government is providing complete support to the Pune Municipal Corporation for the cleanliness and beautification of the Mula-Mutha river.
If the rivers are rejuvenated, the people of the city will also get a huge relief, a new energy.
The most important thing for the development of modern infrastructure in any country is speed and scale.
This Amrit Mahotsav of independence is not just a celebration of 75 years, but celebrating, fulfilling, instilling a new potential, adding a different dimension and intensifying the energy of the dreams of our heroes of independence for independent India and move ahead.
Today, when we are celebrating 75 years of independence, it is the duty of every countryman to make a special contribution at his own level in the development of the nation.
As a nation, India has constantly taken new steps at different levels and tried to do novel things in the last eight years.
People-centric governance and good governance is at the center of such a big change that has come after seven decades of independence.
Instead of going through different websites of different ministries, it is better that he has access to one portal of the Government of India for the solution of his problems.
Efforts should now be made so that the financial solutions, which have been prepared for India, should now give solutions to the citizens of other countries of the world.
“'Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav' is the perfect time to think about how India can play a global leadership role in the coming years”
Then, why is it being mocked by the Opposition?
'Nation' is not an arrangement of power or government.
I am here to give Motion of Thanks on the President’s address.
The success of these reforms is dependent on strengthening their financing”
“Our Financing Sector will also have to consider innovative financing and sustainable risk management of new futuristic ideas and initiatives”
“India’s aspirations are also linked with natural farming and organic farming”
“it is necessary to accelerate environment friendly projects.
All my cabinet colleagues, experts from the fields of finance and economy, stakeholders, ladies and gentlemen!
It is a reflection of our economic decisions and the robust foundation of our economy.
In this budget, the government has taken several steps to continue this momentum of rapid growth.
By encouraging foreign capital flows, reducing tax on infrastructure investment, creating institutions like NIIF, GIFT City and new DFIs, we have tried to accelerate financial and economic growth.
The country's commitment to the widespread use of digital technology in finance is now reaching the next level.
The 75 Digital Banking Units as well as Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDCs) in 75 districts reflect our vision.
The help of financial institutions in many such areas will take India to new heights in Industry 4.0.
India's aspirations are connected to organic farming, natural farming.
In Indian history, Meerut has not just been a city but a significant center of our culture and strength.
From the times of Ramayana and Mahabharata to Jain Tirthankaras and Bhai Dharam Singh, one of the Panj-Pyaars, Meerut has energized the nation's faith.
.From the Indus Valley Civilization to the country's first freedom struggle, this region has shown the world what India is capable of.
Meerut has also been the workplace of Major Dhyan Chand ji, another great son of the country.
A few months ago, the central government named the country's biggest sports award after Dadda.
Today, Meerut Sports University is being dedicated to Major Dhyan Chand ji.
The immense talent of the youth of the country was confined due to government apathy.
Our government has given these four tools to the players of India in the past few years on a priority basis.
We have linked sports with fitness and employment of the youth, self-employment and their careers.
The Target Olympic Podium Scheme, i. e. TOPS, has been one such effort.
Talent is being identified in every corner of the country at a very young age through the Khelo India campaign.
Every possible help is being given to such players to make them athletes of the international level.
It is because of these efforts that when an Indian player enters the international arena today, then his performance is appreciated by the world.
Last year we saw in the Olympics, we saw in the Paralympics.
What was never happened before in history was done by the heroic sons and daughters of my country in the last Olympics.
This double benefit, double speed is the identity of the double engine government.
Governor of Jharkhand Shri Ramesh Bais ji, Chief Minister Shri Hemant Soren ji, my colleague in the Union Cabinet Shri Jyotiraditya Scindia ji, Ministers of the Government of Jharkhand, MP Nishikant ji, other MPs and MLAs, ladies and gentlemen,
These are going to give a lot of impetus to Jharkhand's modern connectivity, energy, health, faith and tourism.
These projects will not only make life easier for lakhs of people of Jharkhand, many new opportunities will be created for business, trade, tourism, employment and self-employment.
These projects are being launched in Jharkhand, but many areas of Bihar and West Bengal, apart from Jharkhand, will also be directly benefited.
Under the UDAN scheme, more than 70 new places have been either connected with airports, heliports or water aerodromes in the last five-six years.
Along with connectivity, the central government is also emphasizing on better facilities at important places related to faith and spirituality of the country.
In Baba Baidyanath Dham too, modern facilities have been expanded under the PRASAD scheme.
When work is done with a holistic approach, then every section of the society and sector gets new means of income in the form of tourism.
Such modern facilities in the tribal area are going to change the fate of this area.
Together we have to accelerate the pace of such development.

With the blessings of UP, all of you have given me the responsibility of working as the country's Pradhan Sevak for the last eight years.
Law and order has also improved under the Yogi ji-led government and connectivity is also improving rapidly.
This will also help a lot the Defense Corridor being built in Bundelkhand.

If some states lag behind; if the people of some states yearn for basic facilities; then this inequitable development is not good for the development of the nation; it is not right.
This is what the people of Tripura have seen and felt here for decades.
Before coming here, I went to see the newly constructed terminal building and other facilities of Maharaja Bir Bikram Airport.
New National Education Policy is being implemented in the country to get visionary youth who will modernize India in the 21st century.
emphasis has been laid on teaching in the local language.
The time of ‘Amrit Kaal’ (virtuous period) is not for dreaming while sleeping, but for fulfilling resolutions while remaining awake.

Today, the Brahma Kumaris Sanstha is starting a huge campaign from the Amrit Mahotsav of freedom towards a golden India from this holy place.
The participation of women in the country's democracy is also increasing.
We saw how more women voted than men in the 2019 elections.
Today, women ministers are handling important responsibilities in the government of the country.
These changes indicate what the new India will be like, and how powerful it will be.
Your efforts will surely give new energy and strength to the country.
A lot goes on in this at the international level as well.
We cannot escape this by saying that it is just politics.
Organizations that have a presence in many countries of the world in an international arena, they should convey the truth about India to the people of other countries, the rumors being spread about India, tell the truth to the people there, make them aware. This is also the responsibility of all of us.
.In all the countries where you have branches, efforts should be made that at least 500 people from each branch come to visit India every year.

We are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Sri Aurobindo this year, and this year also marks the 100th death anniversary of the great poet Subramania Bharati.
Both these sages have a special relationship with Puducherry.
Both have been partners in each other's literary and spiritual journey.
Today the world looks up to India with hope and trust
Whenever India needs to fight injustice and tyranny, the sacrifices of Guru Gobind Singh Ji's sons still show the way.
When India needed a revolution for obtaining freedom, countless youths like Sardar Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad and Netaji Subhas had given everything up for the country.
When India needs the power of spirituality and creativity, one thinks of great personalities like Sri Aurobindo and Subramania Bharati.
Today, the youth of India have both the ability to put in labour as well as a clear vision of the future.
That is why, what India says today, the world considers it to be a call of tomorrow.
The young generation that was there at the time of independence had sacrificed everything for the country without a second thought.
This is the threshold of new dreams and new resolutions for India.
In such a situation, the strength of the youth of India will take India to new heights.
India today has a strong ecosystem of more than 50 thousand startups.
Out of this, more than 10 thousand start-ups have been formed in the last 6-7 months amid the challenges of Corona.
With this mindset, the government has decided to raise the age of marriage for girls to 21 years for the welfare of daughters.
We have to celebrate the festival with complete caution and vigilance due to Corona.
Today, all of us are witnessing a grand event for health and wellness all over the world.
I am extremely grateful to the Director General of WHO Dr Tedros.
And I especially congratulate him for the way he has made a confluence of Gujarati, Hindi and English and has touched the hearts of every Indian.
I also express my gratitude to my dear friend and Prime Minister of Mauritius Shri Jugnauth ji.
I have also had a relationship with his family for almost three decades.
We just heard the views of the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, the Prime Minister of Bhutan and the Prime Minister of Nepal.
I am grateful to all of them.
This Centre, in collaboration with traditional medicine spread across the world, will help in providing better medical solutions to the people around the world.
More than five decades ago, the world's first Ayurveda University was established in Jamnagar.
Many of you know that apart from healing and treatment in Ayurveda, social health, mental health, happiness, environmental health, compassion, empathy, sensitivity and productivity too are included in this 'Amrit kalash'.
For example, good health is directly related to a balanced diet.
Our ancestors believed that half the cure for any disease lay in a balanced diet.
I am glad that India's proposal to promote the use of millets has been accepted by the United Nations.
And now, I express my heartfelt gratitude to both the guests for sparing their time, for adding glory to this ceremony and making the event more relevant.
Once again thanks a lot to all of you.
“When the aspirations of others become your aspirations and when fulfilling the dreams of others becomes the measure of your success, then that path of duty creates history”
Today aspirational districts are removing the barriers to the progress of the country.
“Today, during the Azadi ka Amrit Kaal, the country's goal is to achieve 100% saturation of services and facilities”
“The country is witnessing a silent revolution in the form of Digital India.
No district should be left behind in this.
Present in the programme with us are Hon’ble Chief Ministers of different states of the country, Lieutenant Governors, my colleagues in the Union Cabinet, all the ministers of the states, secretaries of various ministries, District Magistrates, Collectors, Commissioners, other dignitaries, and ladies and gentlemen,
But when the aspirations of others become our own aspirations, when fulfilling the dreams of others becomes the measure of our success, then that path of the duty creates history.
Today we are witnessing this history being made in the aspirational districts of the country.
A direct and emotional connection between the administration and the public is very important for development in aspirational districts.
And the important aspect of this campaign is technology and innovation!
There has been an increase of 4 to 5 times in Jan Dhan accounts in almost every aspirational district of the country in the last four years.
Almost every family has got a toilet and electricity has reached every village.
That is, we have a long way to go from what we have achieved so far.
It is very important that digital infrastructure should reach every village in our country and become a means of door-step delivery of services and facilities.
This is a new opportunity and a challenge for all the governments, the Government of India, state governments, district administration and the government machinery.
Now we have to meet this challenge together.
You must remember the day when it was your first day in this service.
